\begin_layout Standard
(Peter Lynch) The earlier depression in 1930s was caused by an economic
 slowdown in a country in which 66% of the work force was in manufacturing,
 22% was in farming, and there was no social security, unemployment compensation
, pension plans, welfare and medicare payments, guaranteed student loans,
 or government-insured bank accounts.
 Today (as of, early 21.century), manufacturing represents only 27% of the
 work force, agriculture accounts for a mere 3%, and the service sector,
 which was 12% in 1930, has grown steadily through recession and boom and
 now accounts for 70% of the U.S.
 work force.
 Unlike the thirties, today a large percentage of people own their own homes;
 many own them free and clear or have watched their equity grow substantially
 as property values have soared.
 Today, the average household has 2 wage earners instead of one, and that
 provides an economic cushion that didn't exist in 1930s.
 If we have a depression, it won't be like the last one!

Correlation does not equal causation.
 This is a very common forecasting problem.
 For example, there are many economic indicators and variables in play.
 If you try to predict the stock market using these historical data, you're
 almost guaranteed to find that some of the variables will almost definitely
 seem to have strong predictive power.
 Yet, they may not.
 You may have just been fooled by randomness.
 Whenever you make a prediction, be sure that there is a logical explanation
 for the mathematical relationship.
 Do not trust data unconditionally.

Howard Marks on forecasts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Predictions are most useful when they correctly anticipate change.
 If you predict that something won't change and it doesn't change, that
 prediction is unlikely to earn you much money.
 But accurately predicting change can be very profitable.
 Important thing in forecasting isn't getting it right once.
 The important thing is getting it right consistently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most of the time, people predict a future that is a lot like the recent
 past.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
They are not necessarily wrong - most of the time the future largely is
 a rerun of the recent past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the basis of the previous 2 points, it's possible to conclude that forecasts
 will prove accurate much of the time: they'll usually extrapolate recent
 experience and be right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, the many forecasts that correctly extrapolate past experience are
 of little value.
 Just as forecasters usually assume a future that's a lot like the past,
 so do markets, which usually price in a continuation of recent history.
 Thus if the future turns out to be like the past, it's unlikely big money
 will be made, even by those who foresaw correctly that it would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once in a while, however, the future turns out to be very different from
 the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It's at these times that accurate forecasts would be of great value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It's also at these times that forecasts are least likely to be correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some forecasters may turn out to be correct at these pivotal moments, suggesting
 that it's possible to correctly forecast key events, but it's unlikely
 to be the same people consistently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The sum of this discussion suggests that, on balance, forecasts are of very
 little value.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The trouble with inconsistent forecasters - not that they are never right,
 but that the record isn't positive enough to inspire action on their occasional
 brainstorms.
 And also, the problem is that people ignore the possibility of improbable
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investors who feel they know what the future holds will act assertively
 - making directional bets, concentrating positions, levering holdings and
 counting on future growth - in other words, doing things that in the absence
 of foreknowledge would increase risk.
 On the other hand, those who feel they don't know what the future holds
 will act quite differently: diversifying, hedging, levering less (or not
 at all), emphasizing value today over growth tomorrow, staying high in
 the capital structure, and generally girding for a variety of possible
 outcomes.
 The first group of investors did much better in the years leading up to
 the crash.
 But the second group was better prepared when the crash unfolded, and they
 had more capital available (and more-intact psyches) with which to profit
 from purchases made at its nadir.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you know the future, it's silly to play defense.
 You should behave aggressively and target the greatest winners; there can
 be no loss to fear.
 Diversification is unnecessary and maximum leverage can be employed.
 On the other hand, if you don't know what the future holds, it's foolhardy
 to act as if you do.
 Working within the limits of what you know rather than venturing beyond
 - can give you a great advantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Howard's opinion on economic forecasts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Most are just extrapolations.
 Extrapolations are usually correct but not valuable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unconventional forecasts of significant deviation from trend would be very
 valuable if they were correct, but usually they aren't.
 Thus most forecasts of deviation from trend are incorrect and also not
 valuable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A few forecasts of significant deviation turn out to be correct and valuable
 - leading their authors to be lionized for their acumen - but it's hard
 to know in advance which will be the few right ones.
 Since the overall batting average with regard to them is low, unconventional
 forecasts can't be valuable on balance.
 There are forecasters who became famous for a single dramatic correct call,
 but the majority of their forecasts weren't worth following.

Aswath Damodaran on market timing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Market timing is higher level decision about asset allocation.
 Most investors, especially old time value investors almost religiously
 will tell you that they are not market timers.
 True is, that we all are market timers.
 At least at some point in time in investing, we time markets.
 We do it implicitly sometimes by holding back cash or explicitly by actually
 time the markets.
 But market timing is built into every investor's gene.
 Here is the reason - if you can time the market, a payoff is immense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The problem with market timing, except taxes and transaction costs, is the
 you can be out at the wrong time - in the process of switching from stocks
 to cash and back, you may miss the best years of the market.
 In 1975, Bill Sharpe suggested in his article on market timing, that unless
 you can tell a good year from a bad year 7 times out of 10, you should
 not try market timing.
 So you have to be right at least 70-80% of the time to break even from
 market timing.
 This was confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations on the Canadian market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are 5 ways how to time the market:

 stories, news, etc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Technical indicators, such as (past) price charts, the January indicator,
 market volatility, trading volume (not just on stocks, but also on options),
 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mean reversion indicators (it's usually PE ratios for stocks and interest
 rates for bonds), where stocks and bonds are viewed as mispriced if they
 trade outside what is viewed as a normal range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Macro economic variables, such as interest rates, inflation and GNP growth
 and devise investing rules based upon the levels or changes in the macroeconomi
c variables.
 Over time, a number of rules of thumb have been devised that relate stock
 returns to the level of interest rates or the strength of the economy.
 For instance, we are often told that it is best to buy stocks when GNP
 growth is strong, treasury bill rates are low, treasury bond rates have
 dropped.
 But according to some studies, it's very difficult to really find a general
 pattern here.
 There is some evidence of mean reversion, but not strong enough to actually
 make a lot of money out of it.
 It's really difficult and not easily predictable to make money from macroeconom
ic indicators, because there is small correlation between the variable did
 a given year and what the stock prices will do the following year.

 Trees don't grow to the sky.
 Few things go to zero.
 And there's little that's as dangerous for investor health as insistence
 on extrapolating today's events into the future."

In investing, as in life, there are very few sure things.
 Values can evaporate, estimates can be wrong, circumstances can change,
 and "sure things" can fail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, there are two concepts we can hold to with confidence:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Rule number one: most things will prove to be cyclical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come
 when other people forget rule number one.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The main reason for cyclicality in our world is the involvement of humans.
 And people are emotional and inconsistent, not steady and clinical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cycles will never stop occurring.
 If there were such a thing as completely efficient market, and if people
 really made decisions in a calculating and unemotional manner, perhaps
 cycles (or at least their extremes) would be banished.
 But that will never be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ignoring cycles and extrapolating trends is one of the most dangerous things
 an investor can do.
 When things are going well, extrapolation introduces great risk.
 Whether it's company profitability, capital availability, price gains,
 or market liquidity, things that inevitably are bound to regress toward
 the mean are often counted on to improve forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fear/greed cycle is caused by changing attitudes toward risk.
 When greed is prevalent, it means investors feel a high level of comfort
 with risk and the idea of bearing it in the interest of profit.
 Conversely, widespread fear indicates a high level of aversion to risk.
 The academics consider investors' attitude toward risk a constant, but
 certainly it fluctuates greatly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Just like the oscillation of cycles, we never know:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
how far the pendulum will swing in its arc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what might cause the swing to stop and turn back
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
when this reversal will occur
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
how far it will then swing in the opposite direction 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The swing back from the extreme is usually more rapid - and thus takes much
 less time - than the swing to the extreme ("The air goes out of the balloon
 much faster than it went in.")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Markets will always create opportunities, whether now or later.
 In markets with few opportunities, it's important to be patient.
 Value opportunities will eventually present themselves, usually after no
 more than a year or two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a bullish phase...to hold sway, the environment has to be characterized
 by greed, optimism, exuberance, confidence, credulity, daring, risk tolerance
 and aggressiveness.
 But these traits will not govern a market forever.
 Eventually they will give way to fear, pessimism, prudence, uncertainty,
 skepticism, caution, risk aversion and reticence.
 Busts are the product of booms, and Marks is convinced it's usually more
 correct to attribute a bust to the excesses of the preceding boom than
 to the specific event that sets off the correction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There a re a few things of which we can be sure, and this is one: Extreme
 market behavior will reverse.
 Those who believe that the pendulum will move in one direction forever
 - or reside at an extreme forever - eventually will lose huge sums.
 Those who understand the pendulum's behavior can benefit enormously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inefficiencies - mispricings, misperceptions, mistakes that other people
 make - provide potential opportunities for superior performance.
 Exploiting them is, in fact, the only road to consistent outperformance.
 To distinguish yourself from the others, you need to be on the right side
 of those mistakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most important and common negative influences: greed, fear, willing
 suspension of disbelief (tendency to dismiss logic, history and time-honored
 norms), tendency to conform to the view of the herd rather than resist,
 envy (tendency of investors to compare themselves to others) and ego.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is only one way to describe most investors - trend followers.
 Superior investors are the exact opposite.
 Superior investing requires second-level thinking - a way of thinking that's
 different from that of others, more complex and more insightful.
 By definition, most of the crowd can't share it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On one hand, you never know how far the pendulum will swing, when it will
 reverse, and how far it will then go in the opposite direction.
 On the other hand, we can be sure that, once it reaches an extreme position,
 the market eventually will swing back toward the midpoint (or beyond).
 Investors who believed that the pendulum would move in one direction forever-or
, having reached an extreme, would stay there - are inevitably disappointed.
 On the third hand, however, because of the variability of the many factors
 that influence markets, no tool - not even contrarianism - can be relied
 on completely.
 Contrarianism isn't an approach that will make you money all of the time.
 Much of the time there aren't great market excesses to bet against.
 Even when an excess does develop, it's important to remember that "overpriced"
 is incredibly different from "going down tomorrow".
 Markets can be over- or underpriced and stay that way-or become more so-for
 years.
 It can be extremely painful when the trend is going against you.
 Finally, it's not enough to bet against the crowd.
 You must do things not just because they're the opposite of what the crowd
 is doing, but because you know why the crowd is wrong.
 Only then will you be able to hold firmly to your views and perhaps buy
 more as your positions take on the appearance of mistakes and as losses
 accrue rather than gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You'll do better if you wait for investment to come to you rather than go
 chasing after them.
 You tend to get better buys if you select from the list of things sellers
 are motivated to sell rather than start with a fixed notion as to what
 you want to own.
 An opportunist buys things because they're offered at bargain prices.
 There's nothing special about buying when prices aren't low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At any particular point in time, the investment environment is a given,
 and we have no alternative other than to accept it and invest within it.
 There isn't always a pendulum or cycle extreme to bet against.
 Sometimes greed and fear, optimism and pessimism, and credulousness and
 skepticism are balanced, and thus clear mistakes aren't being made.
 Rather than obviously overpriced or underpriced, most things may seem roughly
 fairly priced.
 In that case, there may not be great bargains to buy or compelling sales
 to make.

 idea where we are.
 That is, even if we can't predict the timing and extent of cyclical fluctuation
s, it's essential that we strive to ascertain where we stand in cyclical
 terms and act accordingly.
 It's reasonable to try to a) stay alert for occasions when a market has
 reached an extreme, b) adjust our behavior in response, and c) most important,
 refuse to fall into line with the herd behavior that renders so many investors

We humans use our ability to recognize and understand patterns to make our
 decision easier, increase benefits and avoid pain.
 Importantly, we depend on our knowledge of recurring patterns so we won't
 have to reconsider every decision from scratch.
 Economies, companies, and markets operate according to patterns or cycles.
 These cycles arise from naturally occurring phenomena in everyday business,
 and to a large extent, from the simple ups and downs of human psychology
 and behavior.
 Because human psychology and behavior play such a big part in creating
 them, these cycles aren't as regular as the cycles of clock and calendar,
 but they still give rise to better and worse times for certain actions.
 And they can profoundly affect investors.
 If we pay attention to cycles, we can come out ahead.
 If we study past cycles, understand their origin and import, and keep alert
 for the next one, we don't have to reinvent the wheel in order to understand
 every investment anew.
 And we have less of a chance of being blindsided by events.
 We can master these recurring patterns for our betterment.

We can most gainfully spend our time in three general areas:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
trying to know more than others about what Howard Marks calls "the knowable";
 the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for a participation
 in those fundamentals, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
understanding the investment environment we're in and deciding how to strategica
lly position our portfolios for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two topics - these constitute the key ingredients in "security
 analysis" and "value investing": judging regarding what an asset can produce
 in the future - usually in terms of earnings or cash flow - and what those
 prospects make the asset worth today.
 The value investors strive to take advantage of discrepancies between "price"
 and "value".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Howard's view, the greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio
 at a given point in time is through deciding what balance it should strike
 between aggressiveness and defensiveness.
 He believes the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted
 over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment
 and where a number of elements stand in their cycles.
 When we are getting value cheap, we should be aggressive; when we are getting
 value expensive, we should pull back.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The future should be viewed not as a single fixed outcome that's destined
 to happen and capable of being predicted, but as a range of possibilities
 and - hopefully on the basis of insight into their respective likelihoods
 - as a probability distribution.
 Probability distributions reflect one's view of tendencies.
 Investors - or anyone hoping to deal successfully with the future - have
 to form probability distributions, either explicitly or informally.
 It it's done well, those probabilities will be helpful in determining one's
 proper course of action.
 But it's still essential to bear in mind that even if we know the probabilities
, that doesn't mean we know what's going to happen.
 Superior investors - like everyone else - don't know exactly what the future
 holds, they do have an above-average understanding of future tendencies.
 Not all predictions should be treated as equally likely to be correct,
 and thus they shouldn't be relied on equally.
 Some events can be predicted with substantial confidence, some are uncertain,
 add some are entirely unpredictable.
 So people should have a view on the likelihood that their opinion will
 prove correct as well, so there are these two requirements, not just one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Superior investor makes helpful judgments about cycles and where we stand
 in them.
 Specifically:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Are we close to the beginning of an upswing, or in the late stages? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a particular cycle has been rising for a while, has it gone so far that
 we're now in dangerous territory? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does investors' behavior suggest they're being driven by greed or by fear?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do they seem appropriately risk-averse or foolishly risk-tolerant?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is the market overheated (and overpriced), or is it frigid (and thus cheap)
 because of what's been going on cyclically?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Taken together, does our current position in the cycle imply that we should
 emphasize defensiveness or aggressiveness? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attention to these elements gives the superior investor an edge that allows
 him to win ore often than he loses.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Most people think of cycles in terms of a series of events.
 And most people understand that these events regularly follow each other
 in a usual sequence: upswings are followed by downswings, and then eventually
 by new upswings.
 But to have a full understanding of cycles, that's not enough.
 The events in the life of a cycle shouldn't be viewed merely as each being
 followed by the next, but - much more importantly - as each *causing* the
 next.
 For example: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
As the phenomenon swings toward an extreme, this movement gives it energy,
 which it stores.
 Eventually its increased weight makes it harder for the swing to continue
 further from the midpoint, and it reaches a maximum beyond which it can
 no longer proceed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Eventually it stops moving in that direction.
 And once it does, gravity then pulls it back in the direction of the central
 tendency or midpoint, with the energy it has amassed powering the swing
 back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And as the phenomenon in question moves from the extreme back toward the
 midpoint, the swing imparts momentum to it that causes it to overshoot
 the midpoint and keep moving toward the opposite extreme.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the worlds investors inhabit, cycles rise and fall, and pendulums swing
 back and forth.
 Cycles and pendulum swings come in many forms and relate to a wide variety
 of phenomena, but the underlying reasons for them - and the patterns they
 produce - have a lot in common, and they tend to be somewhat consistent
 over time.
 As Mark Twain said: "History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."
 The details vary - the timing, duration, speed and power of the swings
 and, very importantly, the reasons for them - and that's likely what's
 behind Twain's remark regarding history not repeating.
 But the underlying dynamics are usually similar.
 In particular, that means the swing back from a high or low almost never
 halts at the midpoint...regardless of how "right" or "appropriate" the midpoint
 may be.
 The continuation of the movement past the midpoint and toward the opposite
 extreme is highly dependable.
 For example, markets rarely go from "underpriced" to "faily priced" and
 stop there.
 Usually the fundamental improvement and rising optimism that cause markets
 to recover from depressed levels remain in force, causing them to continue
 right through "fairly priced" and on to "overpriced".
 It doesn't have to happen, but usually it does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Howard consider the following questions as improper - "what cause f the
 cycle to begin?" or "are we close to the end of the cycle?", because he
 think cycles neither begin nor end.
 Better questions might be: "what caused the current up-leg to begin?" or
 "how far have we gone since the beginning of the up-cycle?" or "are we
 close to the end of the down-leg?".
 Cycles do not have a defined beginning, and he believes they will never
 end.
 The cycle oscillates around the midpoint.
 The midpoint of a cycle is generally thought of as the secular trend, norm,
 mean, average or "happy medium", and generally as being in some sense as
 "right and proper".
 The extremes of the cycle, on the other hand, are thought of as aberrations
 or excesses to be returned from, and generally they are.
 While the thing that's cycling tends to spend much of the time above or
 below it, eventual movement back in the direction of the mean is usually
 the rule.
 The movement from either a high or a low extreme back toward the midpoint
 is often described as "regression toward the mean", a powerful and very
 reasonable tendency in most walks of life.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the swing toward one extreme goes further, the swing back is likely to
 be more violent, and more damage is likely to be done.
 So the potential for havoc increases as the movement away from the midpoint
 increases - as economies and companies do "too well" and stock prices go
 "too high".
 Advances are followed by mere corrections, and bull markets by bear markets.
 But booms and bubbles are followed by much more harmful busts, crashes
 and panics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A cycle in the economic or investment world consists of a series of events
 that give rise to their successors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cycles occur in a variety of areas and cyclical developments in one area
 also influence cycles in others.
 Thus the economic cycle influences the profit cycle.
 Corporate announcements determined by the profit cycle influence investor
 attitudes.
 Investor attitudes influence markets.
 And developments in markets influence the cycle in the availability of
 credit...which influences economies, companies and markets.
 Cycles don't operate in isolation.
 The various cycles operate on their own, but they also continuously affect
 each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is only one form of intelligent investing, and that's figuring out
 what something's worth and buying it for that price or less.
 You can't have intelligent investing in the absence of quantification of
 value and insistence on an attractive purchase price.
 Any investment movement that's built around a concept other than the relationsh
ip between price and value is irrational.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Not every big rise is a bubble.
 For Howard, the term "bubble" has special psychological connotations that
 should be understood and looked out for.
 "No price too high" is the ultimate ingredient in a bubble, and thus a
 foolproof sign of a market gone too far.
 There is no safe way to participate in a bubble, only danger.
 It should be noted, however, that "overpriced" is far from synonymous with
 "going down tomorrow".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The elements that contribute to the market's rise manifest themselves via
 valuation metrics - P/E ratios on stocks, yields on bonds, capitalization
 ratios on real estate, and cash flow multiples on buyouts - that are elevated
 relative to historic norms.
 All of these things are precursors of low prospective returns.
 The reverse is true when a market collapse takes asset prices to bargain
 valuations.
 These things can be observed and quantified.
 In addition, our understanding of cycle positioning can be greatly aided
 by an awareness of how investors are behaving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The key to understanding where we stand in the cycle depends on two forms
 of assessment:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The first is totally quantitative: gauging valuations.
 This is an appropriate starting point, for if valuations aren't out of
 line with history, the market cycle is unlikely to be highly extended in
 either direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And the second is essentially qualitative: awareness of what's going on
 around us, and in particular of investor behavior.
 Importantly, it's possible to be disciplined even in observing these largely
 non-quantitative phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how things are priced and how are investors around us behaving - assessing
 these two elements, consistently and in a disciplined manner, can be very
 helpful.
 The answers will give us a sense for where we stand in the cycle.
 But even the best of temperature-taking can't tell us what will happen
 next ...
 just the tendencies.
 From a given point in the cycle, the market is capable of moving in any
 direction: up, flat, or down.
 But that doesn't mean all three are equally likely.
 Where we stand influences the tendencies or probabilities, even if it does
 not determine future developments with certainty.
 All other things being equal, when the market is high in its cycle, a downward
 correction is more likely than continued gains, and vice versa.
 It doesn't have work out that way, of course, but that's the safer bet.
 Assessing our cycle position doesn't tell us what will happen next, just
 what's more and less likely.
 But that's a lot.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Investors who are capable of both, correctly adjust market exposure at the
 right time and have the asymmetrical performance that comes from a better-than-
average ratio of winners to losers, have a better sense for the market's
 likely tendency and can put together portfolios that are better suited
 for the market environment that likely lies ahead in terms of the ratio
 of winners to losers.
 That's what makes them great...
 and rare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sometimes it can take years for the market to prove those investors right,
 and as one of the most important investment adages says, "Being too far
 ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You shouldn't expect to reach profitable conclusions daily, monthly, or
 even yearly.
 We can't create great opportunities to time the market through our understandin
g of cycles.
 Rather, the market will decide when we'll have them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The important lesson is that - especially in an interconnected, informed
 world - everything that produces unusual profitability will attract incremental
 capital until it becomes overcrowded and fully institutionalized, at which
 point its prospective risk-adjusted return will move toward the mean (or
 worse).
 And, correspondingly, things that perform poorly for a while eventually
 will become so cheap - due to their relative depreciation and the lack
 of investor interest - that they'll be printed to outperform.
 Cycles like these hold the key to success in investing, not trees that
 everyone is assuming will grow to the sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Success isn't good for most people.
 In short, success can change people, and usually not for the better.
 Success makes people think they're smart.
 That's fine as far as it goes, but there can also be negative ramifications.
 Success also tends to make people richer, and that can lead to a reduction
 in their level of motivation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As successes accrue, it's common for people to conclude that they're smart.
 And after making a lot of money in a strongly rising market, they decide
 they've got investing mastered.
 Their faith increases in their own opinions and instinct.
 Their investing comes to reflect less self-doubt, meaning they think less
 about the possibility of being wrong and worry less about the risk of loss.
 This can cause them to no longer insist on the full margin of safety that
 gave rise to their earlier successes.
 This is the reason for one of the oldest and most important investing adages:
 "don't confuse brains with a bull market."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The plain truth is, there's little of value to be learned from success.
 People who are successful run the risk of overlooking the fact that they
 were lucky, or that they had help from others.
 In investing, success teaches people that making money is easy, and that
 they don't have to worry about risk - two particularly dangerous lessons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the principal ways in which success carries the seeds of investment
 failure is through increased popularity.
 Investors should be leery of popular assets.

Not only are good times followed sooner or later by bad times, but - as
 with so many other examples of cycles - good times often produce bad times.
 Good times can lead to unwise debt issuance (distressed debt cycle) or
 to overbuilding (real estate cycle).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A deep understanding of emotions and the overdoing they lead to is one of
 key bottom lines of this book.
 Cyclical deviations from the trend-line are produced largely by overdoing
 and its eventual correction.
 This is obviously true in the securities markets, which are nothing but
 a collection of people making decisions than they hope will prove profitable.
 But it is no less true of economies and companies; they may seem like independe
nt, well-oiled machines, but they, too, are nothing but groups of people
 making decisions, with all that implies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The tendency of people to go to excess will never end.
 And thus, since those excesses eventually have to correct, neither will
 the occurrence of cycles.
 Economies and markets have never moved in a straight line in the past,
 and neither will they do so in the future.
 And that means investors with the ability to understand cycles will find
 opportunities for profit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investment success is like the choosing of a lottery winner.
 Both are determined by one ticket (the outcome) being pulled from a bowlful
 of tickets (the full range of possible outcomes).
 In each case, one outcome is chosen from among the many possibilities.
 Superior investors are people who have a better sense for what tickets
 are in the bowl, and thus for whether it's worth participating in the lottery.
 In other words, while superior investors - like everyone else - don't know
 exactly what the future holds, they do have an above-average understanding
 of future tendencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio at a given point
 in time is through deciding what balance it should strike between aggressivenes
s and defensiveness.
 And Marks believes the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted
 over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment
 and where a number of elements stand in their cycles.
 The key word is "calibrate".
 The amount you have invested, your allocation of capital among the various
 possibilities, and the riskiness of the things you own all should be calibrated
 along a continuum that runs from aggressive to defensive.
 When we're getting value cheap, we should be aggressive; when we're getting
 value expensive, we should pull back.
 Calibrating one's portfolio position is what this book is mostly about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Howard calls attention to the obvious fact that - rather than the everyday
 ups and downs of the market - the clear examples provided in this book

 even yearly.

As Peter Bernstein said, "The future is not ours to know.

 on an unknown future ..."

The tendency of people to go to excess will never end.

There are three ingredients for success - aggressiveness, timing, and skill
 - and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time, you don't need
 that much skill.
 Let's apply a little more thought regarding the formula for investment
 success.
 It should be considered in terms of six main components:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cycle positioning
\series default
 - the process of deciding on the risk posture of your portfolio in response
 to your judgments regarding the principal cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Asset allocation
\series default
 - the process of deciding which markets, market niches and specific securities
 or assets to overweight and underweight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Aggressiveness
\series default
 - the assumption of increased risk: risking more of your capital; holding
 lower-quality assets; making investments that are more reliant on favorable
 macro outcomes; and/or employing financial leverage or high-beta (market-sensit
ive) assets and strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Defensiveness
\series default
 - the reduction of risk: investing less capital and holding cash instead;
 emphasizing safer assets; buying things that can do relatively well even
 in the absence of prosperity; and/or shunning leverage and beta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skill
\series default
 - the ability to make these decisions correctly on balance (although certainly
 not in every case) through a repeatable intellectual process and on the
 basis of reasonable assumptions regarding the future.
 Nowadays this has come to be known by its academic name: "alpha".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Luck
\series default
 - what happens on the many occasions when skill and reasonable assumptions
 prove to be of no avail - that is, when randomness has more effect on events
 than do rational processes, whether resulting in "lucky breaks" or "tough
 luck".
 The luck is the wild-card; it can make good decisioning fail and bad ones
 succeed, but mostly in the short run.
 In the long run, it's reasonable to expect skill to win out.

 assumptions; paying higher prices to do it; and/or lowering the standards
 that have to be met if one is to do it.
 All of these things tend to entail the assumption of greater risk.
\end_layout

The combination of positive psychology and the increase in activity causes
 asset prices to rise, which encourages still more activity, further price

When the news eventually turns less positive and the environment becomes
 less hospitable, the levels of psychology, activity and risk-bearing prove

 The resulting price correction causes psychology to become less positive,
 which causes disinvestment, which puts further downward pressure on prices,
 and so forth.
 These are all elements that most financial cycles have in common, and that
 includes the cycle in real estate.
 But the real estate cycle incorporates another ingredient that the others

An effort to explain life through the recognition of patterns - and thus

Economic cycle = business cycle (term mostly used in the past though).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the main determinants of each year's economic output is the number
 of hours worked.
 In turn, the most fundamental factor underlying increases in hours worked
 is population growth.
 Growth in the population means there are more people working each year
 to make and sell products (and also more people to buy and consume them,
 encouraging production).
 More production equals more GDP.
 If the population is growing, hours worked tend to grow, and so does GDP.
 Thus births are one of the main reasons for the usual presumption that
 economic growth will be positive.
 On the other hand, if the population is shrinking, positive GDP growth
 faces a significant headwind.
 Changes in birth rates generally take place over long periods of time,
 and when they do, they require years to affect GDP growth.
 So year-to-year changes in GDP are unlikely to be attributed significantly
 to changes in the birth rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GDP, in the long run, influences: demographic movements, determinants of
 inputs (such as unemployment rate or # of hours worked by each person),
 aspiration (profit motive and desire to live better for producing more),
 education, technology, automation, and globalization.

Summary of economic cycles:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The output of an economy is economy is the product of hours worked and output
 per hour; thus the long-term growth of an economy is determined primarily
 by fundamental factors like birth rate and the rate of gain in productivity
 (but also by other changes in society and environment).
 These factors usually change relatively little from year to year, and only
 gradually from decade to decade.
 Thus the average rate of growth is rather steady over long periods of time.
 Only in the longest of time frames does the secular growth rate of an economy
 significantly speed up or slow down.
 But it does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long-term economic growth is steady for long periods of time but subject
 to change pursuant to long-term cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Short-term economic growth follows the long-term trend on average, but it
 oscillates around that trend line from year to year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
People try hard to predict annual variation as a source of potential investing
 profit.
 And on average they're close to the truth most of the time.
 But few people do it right consistently; few do it that much better than
 everyone else; and few correctly predict the major deviations from trend.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Extreme economic cyclicality is considered undesirable.
 Too much strength can kindle inflation and take the economy so high that
 a recession becomes inevitable.
 Too much weakness, on the other hand, can cause companies' profits to fall
 and can cost people their jobs.
 Thus it is part of the job of central bankers and Treasury officials to
 manage cycles.
 Since cycles produce ups and downs that can be excessive, the tools for
 dealing with them are counter-cyclical and applied with a cycle of their
 own - ideally inverse to the economic cycle itself.
 However, like everything else involving cycles, managing them is far from
 easy.
 If it weren't, we wouldn't see the extremes we do.

Early on, many central banks issued currency.
 Their primary roles may have been to issue currency and exchange it on
 request for gold or silver.
 Today, central banks are primarily concerned with managing economic cycles,
 with inflation - not to eliminate it, but to control it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The reasons for inflation are somewhat mysterious and unreliable and sporadic.
 Sometimes a given set of circumstances will give rise to inflation, and
 at other times the same circumstances will lead to more or less inflation,
 or to none at all.
 But in general, inflation is viewed as a result of a strong upward movement
 of the economic cycle.

The cost of goods can escalate for any of these reasons.
 That's inflation.
 But sometimes these events can occur without an accompanying acceleration

 And sometimes inflation can increase without these things being present.
 There is a large psychological component that influences all of this.

Central Banks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Central banks can try to influence inflation by reducing the money supply,
 raising interest rates and selling securities.
 When the private sector purchases securities from the central bank, money
 is taken out of circulation; this tends to reduce the demand for goods
 and thus discourages inflation.
 They can accomplish the goal of keeping inflation under control, but they
 also restrain the growth of the economy, with effects that can be less
 than beneficial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most central bankers have two jobs: to limit inflation, which requires restraini
ng the growth of the economy, and to support employment, which calls for
 stimulating economic growth.
 In other words, their dual responsibilities are in opposition to each other,
 and thus their job requires a delicate balancing act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An economic upswing tends to encourage employment but can cause inflation
 to accelerate.
 Stagflation or contraction, on the other hand, discourages inflation but
 can cut into employment.
 So the job of the central banker is to behave appropriately counter-cyclically:
 that is, to limit the extend of cycles, slowing the economy in times of
 prosperity in order to keep inflation under control, and stimulating the
 economy during slowdowns to support employment.
\end_layout

Government

The process that determines a company's profits is complex and multivariate.
 The economic cycle has a profound effect on some companies' sales but less
 on others.
 Largely because of differences in operating and financial leverage, a given
 percentage change in sales has a much greater impact on profits for some
 companies than for others.
 Companies' profits are much more volatile than GDP.
 More GDP means more consumption, and thus stronger demand for goods.
 That, in turn, means greater volumes sold and higher selling prices, more
 work and higher wages, and thus still more consumption.
 All those things together mean increased revenues for businesses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By definition, the collective sales of all businesses are one and the same

Everyday necessities like food, beverages and medicine aren't highly responsive
 to the economic cycle.
 People generally consume them regardless of what's going on in the economy.
 But demand isn't absolutely constant: people trade down in recessions -
 buying cheaper food and eating at home rather than in restaurants - and
 they trade up in times of prosperity.
 And, sadly, people who are struggling financially may cut down even on
 their consumption of "necessities" when forced to choose between food,
 medications and rent payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Purchases of big-ticket "durable goods" - things like cars and homes for
 individuals and trucks and factory equipment for businesses - are highly
 responsive to the economic cycle.
 They are durable so they last a long time, so replacement can be deferred
 in times of economic weakness.
 Also, because they cost a lot, they are hard to afford in bad times and
 easier to afford in good times.
 And businesses generally need more of them when business is god and less
 when it isn't.
 These things make the demand for durables highly responsible to the economic
 cycle.

The superior investor is mature, rational, analytical, objective, and unemotiona

 Thus he performs a thorough analysis of investment fundamentals and the
 investment environment.
 He calculates the intrinsic value of each potential investment asset.
 And he buys when any discount of the price from the current intrinsic value,
 plus any potential increases in intrinsic value in the future, together
 suggest that buying at the current price is a good idea.
 In order to be able to do all the above, the superior investor strikes
 an appropriate balance between fear (which is shorthand for risk aversion,
 dislike for loss, and respect for uncertainty and randomness) and greed
 (a.k.a.
 aspiration, aggressiveness and acquisitiveness).
 All people feel emotions, but superior investor keeps those conflicting
 elements in balance.
 The presence of the two offsetting forces leads to responsible, wise, and
 even-keeled behavior.
 The superior investor resists psychological excesses and thus refuses to
 participate in extreme swings in psychological extremes.
 Emotional investors will need a great deal of self-awareness and self-restraint
 to become good investors.

Investor psychology rarely gives equal weight to both favorable and unfavorable

 Likewise, investors' interpretation of events is usually biased by their

 as much sense as saying "everyone knows the market has gone too far." If

Howard Marks On Credit Cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Howard believes that the credit cycle is the most volatile of the cycles
 and has the greater impact.
 Thus it deserves a great deal of attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The ups and downs of economies are usually blamed for fluctuations in corporate
 profits, and fluctuations in profits for the rise and fall or securities
 markets.
 However, in recessions and recoveries, economic growth usually deviates
 from its trend-line rate by only a few percentage points.
 Why, then, do corporate profits increase and decrease so much more? The
 answer lies in things like financial leverage and operating leverage, which
 magnify the impact on profits of rising and falling revenues.
 And if profits fluctuate this way -why is it that the securities markets
 soar and collapse so dramatically? It's because of fluctuations in psychology
 and, in particular, to the profound influence of psychology on the availability
 of capital.
 In short, whereas economies fluctuate a little and profits a fair bit,
 the credit window opens wide and then slams shut.
 Howard believes that the credit cycle is the most volatile of the cycles
 and has the greatest impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changes in the availability of capital or credit constitute one of the most
 fundamental influences on economies, companies, and markets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\series bold
Why is credit so important?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Capital or credit is an essential ingredient in the productive process.
 Thus the ability of companies (and economies) to grow usually depends on
 the availability of incremented capital.
 If the capital markets are closed, it can be hard to finance growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Capital must be available in order for maturing debt to be refinanced.
 Companies (also governments and consumers) generally don't pay off their
 debts.
 Most of the time they merely roll them over.
 But if a company is unable to issue new debt at the time that its existing
 debt comes due, it may default and be forced into bankruptcy.
 Where we stand in the credit cycle - whether credit is readily available
 or difficult to obtain - is the greatest determinant of whether debt can
 be refinanced at a given time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many corporate assets are long-term in nature (like buildings, machinery,
 vehicles and goodwill).
 Yet corporations often raise the money with which to buy those things by
 issuing short-term debt.
 They do this because the cost of borrowing is generally lowest on short
 maturities.
 This arrangement - "borrowing short to invest long" - works out well most
 of the time, when the credit market is open and fully functioning, meaning
 debt can be rolled over with ease when it comes due.
 But the mismatch between long-term assets that can't be easily liquidated
 and shorter-term liabilities can easily bring on a crisis if the credit
 cycle turns negative so that maturing debt can't be refinanced.
 This classic mismatch, when combined with stringency in the financing markets,
 is often the cause of the most spectacular financial meltdowns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Financial institutions represent a special, exaggerated case of reliance
 on the credit markets.
 Financial institutions are in the business of trading in money, and they
 need access to financing to keep that business going.
 They also are often the site of the greatest short/long mismatches and
 potential meltdowns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The credit market gives off signals that have great psychological impact.
 A closed credit market causes fear to spread, even out of proportion to
 businesses' negative realities.
 Difficult conditions can cause the capital market to close...and closed capital
 markets can have a negative impact on business conditions (as well as on
 market participants' opinions of businesses).
 This kind of "vicious circle" is part of most financial crises.

\begin_layout Standard
At the extreme the process is ready to be reversed again.
 Because the competition to make loans or investments is low, high returns

 In this way, a recovery begins to be fueled.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which
 produces large losses, which makes lenders stop ending, which ends prosperity,
 and so on.
 A market is an auction house where the item being offered goes to the person
 who'll pay the most for it.
 The financial markets are no different.
 The opportunity to make an investment or provide a loan goes to the market
 participant who'll pay the most for that opportunity.
 The bidding takes the price to higher dollar levels and higher valuation
 parameters (such as P/E ratios).
 In the credit market, a high price or high valuation parameters translates
 directly into a low yield on the debt instrument in question, and the change
 to provide capital goes to the lender who'll accept the lowest yield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From time to time, providers of capital simply turn spigot on or off - as
 in so many things, to excess.
 There are times when anyone can get any amount of capital for any purpose,
 and times when even the most deserving borrowers can't access reasonable
 amounts for worth-while projects.
 The behavior of the capital markets is a great indicator of where we stand
 in terms of psychology and a great contributor to the supply of investment

And, ultimately, market participants demonstrated that when negative psychology

 When all optimism has been driven out, and panicked risk aversion is everywhere

The sub-prime mortgage bubble arose from broad acceptance that phenomena

The credit cycle is sometimes referred to as the capital market cycle rather

 Howard doesn't find the distinction important.
 Strictly speaking, "capital" refers to all the money used to finance a

 that's made up of debt rather than equity.
 Howard sticks to "the credit cycle" when he's only talking about debt markets,

The key to dealing with the credit cycle lies in recognizing that it reaches
 its apex when things have been going well for a while, news has been good,
 risk aversion is low, and investors are eager.
 That makes it easy for borrowers to raise money and causes buyers and investors
 to compete for the opportunity to provide it.
 The result is cheap financing, low credit standards, weak deals, and the
 unwise extension of credit.
 Borrowers hold the cards when the credit window is wide open - not lenders
 or investors.
 The implications of all this should be obvious - proceed with caution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The exact opposite becomes true at the other extreme of the credit cycle.
 Its nadir is reached when developments are unpleasant, risk aversion is
 heightened, and investors are depressed.
 Under such circumstances, no one wants to provide capital, the credit market
 freezes up, and proposed offerings go begging.
 This puts the cards into the hands of providers of capital rather than
 the borrowers.
 Because borrowing is difficult and capital is generally unavailable, those
 who possess it and are willing to part with it can apply rigorous standards,
 insist on strong loan structures and protective covenants, and demand high
 prospective returns.
 It's things like these that provide the margin of safety required for superior
 investing.
 When these boxes can be ticked, investors should swing into an aggressive
 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Superior investing doesn't come from buying high-quality assets, but from
 buying when the deal is good, the price is low, the potential return is
 substantial, and the risk is limited.
 These conditions are much more the case when the credit markets are in
 less-euphoric, more-stringent part of their cycle.
 The slammed-shut phase of the credit cycle probably does more to make bargains
 available than any other single factor.

(Howard Marks) Asking for investment advice without specifying the attitude
 toward risk and return, is like asking a doctor for a good medicine without
 telling him what ails you.
 Howard asks clients or friends: Which do you care about more, making money
 or avoiding losses? The answer is invariably the same - both.
 The problem is that you can't simultaneously go all out for both profit
 making and loss avoidance.
 Each investor has to take a position regarding these two goals, and usually
 that requires striking a reasonable balance.
 The best way to put this decision into perspective is by thinking of it
 in terms of offense versus defense.

(Howard Marks) Defensive investing
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It can be seen as an attempt at higher returns, but more through the avoidance
 of minuses than through the inclusion of pluses, and more through consistent
 but perhaps moderate progress than through occasional flashes of brilliance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are 2 principal elements in investment defense.
 The first is the exclusion of losers from portfolios.
 This is best accomplished by conducting extensive due diligence, applying
 high standards, demanding a low price and generous margin for error and
 being less willing to bet on continued prosperity, rosy forecasts and developme
nts that may be uncertain.
 The second element is the avoidance of poor years and especially, exposure
 to meltdown in crashes.
 In addition to the ingredients described previously that help keep individual
 losing investments from the portfolio, this aspect of investment defense
 requires thoughtful portfolio diversification, limits on the overall riskiness
 borne, and a general tilt toward safety.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Concentration and leverage are two examples of offense.
 They'll add to returns when they work but prove harmful when they don't
 - again, the potential for higher highs and lower lows from aggressive
 tactics.
 The critical element in defensive investing is what Warren Buffett calls
 "margin of safety" or "margin for error" (they are the same thing).

At Oaktree, they believe that if they avoid the losers, the winners will

(Graham) There are 2 types of investors - defensive and aggressive role.
 There is no room in this philosophy for a middle ground, or a series of
 gradations, between passive and aggressive status.
 Many, perhaps most, investors seek to place themselves in such an intermediate
 category.
 In Graham's opinion that is a compromise that is more likely to produce
 disappointment than achievement.
 As an investor you cannot soundly become "half a businessman".

Defensive Investor

\begin_layout Itemize
Preferred stocks should be bought on a bargain basis (when their price is
 depressed by temporary adversity) or not at all.
 And Graham argues that corporate bonds should be also avoided.
 So US Savings bonds and common stocks should be a way to go for a defensive
 investor.
\end_layout

Bad things about bonds:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Good bonds carry no protection against inflation.
 The bondholder suffers the full effect of any loss in purchasing power
 of the dollars that he lent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Good common stocks provide a better degree of protection against inflation
 than do high-grade bonds.
 A number of investment authorities have insisted that common stocks are
 by no means a perfect hedge against inflation, and they are right.
 Nevertheless, there is a sound theoretical basis for expecting their dividends
 and their average market value to be pushed upward by the forces of inflation.
 Past experience shows that this has in fact occurred and that the careful
 common-stock buyer has gained somewhat in income and principal value to
 offset the inroads of inflation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A typical bond - when interest rates go down, the call feature forces the

The selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive investor
 is a relatively simple matter:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Adequate, but not excessive diversification - 10-30 stocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each selected company should be large, prominent, conservatively financed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The price paid for each should be reasonable in relation to its average
 earnings for the last 5 years or longer.
 Graham recommends a price not to exceed 20 times of such earnings.
 This would protect the investor against the common error of buying good
 stocks at high levels of the general market.
 It would also bar the purchase, even in normal markets, of a number of
 fine issues which sell at unduly high prices in anticipation of greatly
 increased future earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Common stock investment, however, as a whole presents a psychological hazard,
 because stock buyers are subject to human weakness and are prone to talk
 like investors and to act like speculators.
 But if an intelligent investor will stick to high0grade stocks bought at
 reasonable prices - then he can do better than the bond investor.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In a period of wide fluctuations in stock prices, dollar averaging will
 show better results than the method of purchasing a fixed number of shares
 each year regardless of price.
 For most investors, Graham thinks, the real meaning of dollar averaging
 indicates that they should be wary of putting more money in stocks at higher
 prices than they did at lower prices - which is a common failing - and
 that they should never let a lower price level scare them away from buying.
\end_layout

Aggressive investor
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(Or as Graham call him, the enterprising investor) He should start from
 the same base as the defensive investor, namely, a division of his funds
 between UK Savings Bonds and high-grade common stocks bought at reasonable
 prices.

 under 4 heads
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

Buying in low markets and selling in high markets (formula timing)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple application of this idea would be to sell 10% of your holdings
 when the market advances 10% above a chosen base or central level; then
 to sell 20% of the remainder when it advances another 10%, and so on.
 Repurchases would be made after the market had declined to the central
 level, and on some similar schedule.
 Following this plan, you would have sold all your stocks if and when the
 market level reached double the base figure, and you would then have realized
 a profit of 37% above the base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buying carefully chosen "growth stocks" 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for good results in the growth stock field there is need not only for
 skillful analysis but for ample diversification as well.
 The enterprising investor may properly buy growth stocks.
 He should beware of paying excessively for them, and he might well limit
 the price by some practical rule.
 A growth-stock program will not be automatically successful; its outcome
 depend on the foresight and judgment of the investor or his advisers rather
 than on any clear-cut methods of analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buying bargain issues of various types 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Graham defines a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts established
 by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more than it is selling for.
 AN issue is not a true "bargain" unless the indicated value is at least
 50% more than the price.
 There are 2 tests by which a bargain common stock is detected: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method of appraisal - TODO chapter X.
 It relies largely on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these
 by a factor appropriate to the particular issue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Value of the business to a private owner.
 This value also is often determined chiefly by expected future earnings
 - in which case the result may be identical with the first.
 But in this second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable
 value of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current assets
 or working capital.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Buying into "special situations" 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
A particular kind of undervalued security in which the profit is expected
 to be realized from a definite corporate event rather than from a mere
 change in the market's attitude is known as a "special situation." Such
