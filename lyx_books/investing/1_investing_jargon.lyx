\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
(Peter Lynch) Size of a company has a great deal to do with what you can
 expect to get out of the stock.
 Big companies don't have big stock moves.
 In certain markets they perform well, but you'll get your biggest moves
 in smaller companies.
 You don't buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple
 your money in two years.
 If you buy Coca-Cola at the right price, you might triple your money in
 six years, but you're not going to hit the jackpot in two.
 Sometimes a series of misfortunes will drive a big company into desperate
 straits, and, as it recovers, the stock will make a big move.
 These are extraordinary situations that fall into the category of turnarounds.
 In the normal course of business, multibillion-dollar enterprises simply
 cannot grow fast enough to become tenbaggers.
 Everything else being equal, you'll do better with the smaller companies.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Float
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Float refers to the number of outstanding shares available to trade.
 When the company did the initial IPO, they released shares.
 The Float is equal to the supply level.
 Stocks with limited supply and high demand are the ones that move up or
 down the fastest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That number is typically the float, although there are 3 ways the number
 of shares can change.
 This outstanding float does not change when traders buy or sell stock,
 but there are three instances where it can change:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Share Buyback Programs (see below)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Secondary Offerings: when the company decides to sell more shares onto the
 open market to raise money (floats increase).
 This is common among small cap stocks and dilutes the value of the stock.
 Even if a company performs multiple secondary offerings, they are always
 called secondary (not third, fourth, etc).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stock Splits (see below)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This is important to pay attention to because when a float is increased,
 there are more shares available to trade and will then require more buying
 and selling to move the price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some day traders focus on finding stocks with low floats since this means
 that the stocks are more likely to make big moves (due to less liquidity).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Stock Split
\emph default
 (there is a
\emph on
 forward split 
\emph default
and also a
\emph on
 reverse split
\emph default
) 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It can result in either an increase or a decrease in float (traditional
 splits will increase it while reverse splits will decrease it).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When a company chooses to increase or decrease the amount of shares which
 increases or decreases the stock price by equal amount.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No value was added or lost, market capitalization is the same after the
 split.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reverse split - a company can decide this if a share price is too low, so
 that they will not be delisted.
 It's usually a bad sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So if the company decreases its share price, smaller investors can get invested
 in that.
 It you have 1 share worth of $100, and a company announces a stock split,
 it decreases its share to $10 per each, then you have 10 shares instead
 of original one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dividend yield is not changed.
 It is still the same percentage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why companies are doing it? Attract investors with lover capital, because
 shares are cheaper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since it's cheaper, it increases the liquidity.
 More trading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mathematically, stock splits are completely irrelevant to investors but
 they are often a sign of good things to come.
 A company usually won't split its stock unless it's optimistic about the
 future.
 Think about it.
 Would you cut your stock price in half or more if the market was about
 to do the same? Of course not.
 Stock splits tend to happen when a company has done well, driven up the
 price of its stock through a split and expects to keep driving up the stock
 price after the split.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(Warren Buffett) Stock splits have 3 consequences:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
they increase transaction costs by promoting high share turnover
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they attract shareholders with short-term, market-oriented views who unduly
 focus on stock market prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
as a result of both of those effects, they lead to prices that depart materially
 from intrinsic business value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With no offsetting benefits, splitting Berkshire's stock would be foolish.
 Not only that, Buffett adds, it would threaten to reverse over three decades
 of hard work that has attracted to Berkshire a shareholder group comprised
 of more focused and long-term investors than probably any other major public
 corporation.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Stock Buybacks
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When the company decides to buy back some of the shares they have released
 onto the open market (floats decrease).
 Warren Buffett said that it makes sense when the market is valuing them
 at less than the company, and when the company has no other pressing need
 for cash.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When a company decides to buy back its own shares on public market from
 shareholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The reason why a company would do that is to use its cash to deplete a share
 count, then there is a less amount of shares, which would raise EPS (earning
 per share - so more money for investors, better P/E ratio) as long as their
 profit stays the same or goes up (because there are less shares that are
 counting against the amount of profit that's coming in).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So if a company will buy some shares back, your shares (as an investor)
 are much more valuable, because there is less of them out there.
 Maybe it's a good thing to prefer companies that do share buyback.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(Peter Lynch) Buying back shares brings up another important change in the
 market - the dividend becoming an endangered species.
 The old method of rewarding shareholders seems to have gone the way of
 black-footed ferret.
 It's true that interest rates are lower today than they were in 1989, so
 you'd expect yields on bonds and dividends on stocks to be lower.
 As stock prices rise, the dividend yield naturally falls.
 In the past, when a mature, healthy company routinely raised the dividend,
 it was a sign of prosperity.
 Cutting a dividend or failing to raise it was a sign of trouble.
 Lately, healthy companies are skimping on their dividends and using the
 money to buy back their own shares.
 Reducing the supply of shares increases the earnings per share, which eventuall
y rewards shareholders, although they don't reap the reward until they sell.
 If anybody's responsible for the disappearing dividend, it's the U.S.
 government, which taxes corporate profits, then taxes corporate dividends
 at the full rate, for so-called unearned income.
 To help their shareholders avoid this double taxation, companies have abandoned
 the dividend in favor of the buyback strategy, which boosts the stock price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(Warren Buffett) Buffett fully supports significant stock repurchases at
 times when wide discrepancies exist between price and value.
 As shareholders, we find this encouraging and rewarding for two important
 reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
major repurchases at prices well below per-share intrinsic business value
 immediately increase, in a highly significant way, that value.
 When companies purchase their own stock, they often find it easy to get
 $2 of present value for $1.
 Corporate acquisition programs almost never do as well and, in a discouragingly
 large number of cases, fail to get anything close to $1 of value for each
 $1 expended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
by making repurchases when a company's market value is well below its business
 value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given to actions that
 enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than to actions that expand
 management's domain but that do nothing for (or even harm) shareholders.
 Seeing this, shareholders and potential shareholders increase their estimates
 of future returns from the business.
 This upward revision, in turn, produces market prices more in line with
 intrinsic business value.
 These prices are entirely rational.
 Investors should pay more for a business that is lodged in the hands of
 a manager with demonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the
 hands of a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer.
 The key word is "demonstrated".
 A manager who consistently turns his back on repurchases, when these clearly
 are in the interest of owners, reveals more than he knows of his motivations.
 No matter how often or how eloquently he mouths some public relations-inspired
 phrase such as "maximizing shareholder wealth", the market correctly discounts
 assets lodged with him.
 His heart is not listening to his mouth - and, after a while, neither will
 the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company
 to repurchase its shares:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the company has available funds - cash plus sensible borrowing capacity
 - beyond the near-term needs of the business 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the company finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value,
 conservatively calculated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buffett's opinion (1999) - 
\emph on
"I can't help but feel that too often today's repurchases are dictated by
 management's desire to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

show confidence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-share value."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Share repurchases of underpriced stock can be a value-enhancing way to allocate
 capital, though these are not always what they seem.
 In 1980s and early 1990s, share buy-backs were uncommon and Buffett credited
 managers who recognized that the purchase of a share priced at $1 bug with
 a value of $2 would rarely be inferior to any other use of corporate funds.
 Alas, as often happens, the imitators stepped in and now you frequently
 see companies paying $2 to buy back shares worth $1.
 These value-destroying share repurchases often are intended to prop up
 a sagging share price or to offset the simultaneous issuing of stock under
 stock options exercised at much lower prices.
 Berkshire occasionally embarks on share repurchase programs: when the stock
 trades at a deep discount to intrinsic value.

 Preferred share doesn't have covenants - so there is no such protection
 as with bonds.
\end_layout

Preferred shares can be converted to a fixed number of common shares, but

\begin_layout Itemize
Consists of 30 biggest, well-known US companies.
 Those are chosen by the editors of The Wall Street Journal.
 The list doesn't change very often, maybe once a year or two years.
 That somehow become an index about how stock market is doing in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It was created by Charles H.
 Dow in 1884.
 He chose 11 very active stocks, originally 9 of which were railroads.
 In 1916, the DOW increased to 20 stocks and in 1928 in 30 stocks.
 The Dow is a benchmark for the entire stock market.
 It's an imperfect one, but popular because of its simplicity.
 Other indexes like the S&P500, NASDAQ composite, and Wilshire 5000 capture
 larger cross sections of the market and provide better benchmarks for comparing
 the performance of mutual funds, hedge funds, and other stocks pools.
 But the Dow persists.
 And it recently performed better than S&P 500 - in both during good and
 bad times.
 They are leading, extremely big companies.
 It represents the best of the big guns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The chance of failure is small, and therefore buying them when they are
 cheap is usually a way to safely get a good price.
 You can use a dividend yield to find bargains (this is called as The Dow
 dividend strategy).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The plan can be to spend 15 minutes once a year finding the 10 highest-yield
 Dow stocks, the invest in each.
 Every year thereafter, you repeat the process and adjust your portfolio
 by selling the stocks that no longer make the select group and buying the
 ones that replaced them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can put your money uniformly into 10, or just lower 5 or high 5.
 Low 5 buys the five lowest priced of the 10 stocks.
 O'Higgins advocates this strategy because the lower prices should lead
 to higher percentage gains.
 And you'd then uniformly invest into those 5.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In a research by an investment adviser Mark Pankin, it was shown that Low
 5 was superior strategy.
 Alternative can be the high 5 - you'd put your money into 5 highest yielding
 of the 10 stocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another alternative is to buy DJIA on margin - this strategy should outperform

Primary Market
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
An IPO is one example of a primary market, which is when a company sells
 stocks or bonds to buyers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whether the company has sold shares before or not, in the primary market,
 the shares on offer are always new shares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The primary market in securities is where new issues are sold by corporations
 to acquire new capital via the sale of bonds, preferred stock or common
 stock.
 The sale typically takes place through an investment banker.
 The secondary market is simply trading in outstanding securities.
 It involves transactions between owners after the issue has been sold to
 the public by the company.
 Consequently, the proceeds from the sale do not go to the company, as is
 the case with a primary offering.
 Thus, the price of the security is important to the buyer and seller.

ECN is a computer system that buys and sells orders for securities.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why some companies pay dividends: slower growth companies.
 These are usually safer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why some are not paying dividends: faster growing companies usually want
 to hold onto their money to invest it or simply use the money to build
 their own business.
 Companies are, generally speaking, not paying dividends unless they are
 very confident their future profits are gonna be at least as good as they
 are now if not better.
 So if a company knows for sure that it will grow, it has a strong balance
 sheet, then it's usually paying dividends.

So for example, if you buy stock on January 26th (before ex-dividend date),
 and sell on Record Date (January 30th for example, or you can sell it also
 exactly on ex-dividend date) you should still get dividend on Payable date
 (Feb 15th).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule is a designation from the Securities and Exchange
 Commission (SEC) that is given to traders who make four or more day trades
 in their margin account over a five business day period.
 A day trade is when you purchase or short a security and then sell or cover
 the same security in the same day.

Essentially, if you have a $5,000 account, you can only make three-day trades

A market orders tells the broker to get you shares at current market prices.
 If you send the order to buy 1,000 shares at 5.00, the broker will get you
 1,000 shares, but since you haven’t said the most you are willing to pay,
 they may give you shares at a higher price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Through your broker account, you can submit orders to the stock exchange.
 When some conditions are met, your order will be filled and you will either
 buy or sell shares.
 Each order type can be a buy order or a sell order.
 That is the direction of the order.
 When you place an order, it may not be filled directly.
 For instance, you may have a set a price that is not possible when you
 put the order.
 The order will remain active for a certain amount of time.
 There are two main duration types for orders:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Day order 
\emph default

Market Order
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Buying or selling shares at the price it is traded at a given moment.
 Buys stock immediately with the cheapest price available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default stock market order on all brokers is the Market Order.
 This is the simplest type of order.
 This order will simply buy or sell at the current market price.
 The broker will fill this order at the best available price.
 People use a Market Order when they really want to buy or sell as fast
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generally, you should not use a Market Order.
 There can be some significant differences over time in the price of a stock.
 Using a Stock Market Order can make a large difference.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Limit order
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Buying or selling shares at a certain price you decide.
 The Limit Order should be the most used stock market order type.
 It is very simple and should be your default order type!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Limit Order has a limit at which you want to buy or sell.
 If you have a Buy Limit Order at $50, the order will be filled once there
 are people selling at $50 or below.
 On the other hand, if you have a Sell Limit order at $100, it will be filled
 once there are people buying at $100 or more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A limit order is when you ask your broker to buy you shares and state the
 most you are willing to pay.
 A limit order of 1,000 at 5.05 will not fill higher than that price.
 That means if the price moves quickly, you may not get 1,000 shares.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Stop Order
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The Stop Order is a bit different than the Limit Order.
 It is not really a real order.
 It will place a Market Order once the share reaches a certain price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Sell Stop is always placed below the market price.
 The idea is to limit your losses by selling if the price goes down too
 much.
 For instance, if you use a Sell Stop Order at $100, once the price of the
 stock falls to $100, a Market Order will be placed on the market.
 That means that as soon as it reaches $100, you will sell at the best available
 price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Buy Order, on the other hand, is placed above the market price.
 This is more rarely used.
 The idea is to buy once the price goes up.
 This can be useful if you are shorting the stock and want to protect your
 returns.
 The principle is exactly the same.
 If you use a Buy Order at $50, as soon as the price increases to $50, a
 Market order will be placed.
 You will then buy at the best available price.
 You need to be aware that if the market is moving very fast, your order
 could be filled at a very different than your order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are very few cases where you would need to need this kind of stock
 market order.
 It could make sense to use it to cut your losses if you do some investing
 in individual shares.
 However, if you are mostly a passive investor, you will not need these
 kinds of limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stop orders are a versatile order that can be great for getting in and out
 of trades.
 When you place a stop order you are saying that you want to get in or out
 of a trade when prices hit your stop price and once they do, it turns into
 a market order and will execute at the next available price.
 Stop orders are mainly used for protecting long or short positions once
 you get into a trade.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Stop Limit Order
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Very similar to Stop Order.
 Once again, it is not really an order per se.
 It will emit a Limit Order once a certain price is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The only difference with the Stop Order is that it places a Limit Order
 instead of a Market Order.
 This is a significant difference.
 Once the share price reaches the price of the Stop Order you know that
 the order will be filled.
 Now, if the share price reaches the Stop Limit Order price, you do not
 have this guarantee.
 It will depend on the Limit Price you set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Let’s say you want to sell shares of X if the price goes below 100 but you
 do not want to sell at less than 99.50.
 For this, you can use a Stop Limit Order with a price of 100 and a limit
 of 99.50.
 If the market goes down below 99.50 before the limit order was filled, it
 will not be filled.
 That will protect you from selling lower than you want.
 On the other, if you really wanted to sell, you may be left with your shares
 and the price may go down even more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stop Limit Order offers a little more safety than the Stop Order.
 However, there is no guarantee that the order will be filled.
 This is a bit of a trade-off between speed of execution and price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A stop limit order refers to an order placed with a broker and combines
 the features of both stop and limit orders making a more technical order.
\end_layout

\emph on
Trailing Stop Order
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This last stock market order is the most complicated to understand but it
 is also the most powerful.
 A Trailing Stop Order can be very useful.
 But there is often little reason to use it, compared to a Market Order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Jason Kelly loves Trailing Stop Order and uses 10% trailing stop for example.
 To him, this is one of the least stressful ways to maximize profits.
 But he says that using it is usually a trader's mind-set, and in most cases
 you'll be better served by an investor's mindset.
 If you did thorough research and believe in the company, it should be better
 to buy more shares at the cheaper price, not to dump the first ones.
 Not always, though, and in cases where you want to stop the loss but leave
 room for recovery, a trailing stop will be your friend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As its name indicates, this order will trail the price of a share.
 You can either trail with a fixed amount or with a percentage.
 The trailing effect will be done as the price is going up for a Sell Order
 and as the price is going down for a Buy Order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most common usage is for a sell order.
 You can use a Trailing Stop Sell Order to secure the returns on a long
 position.
 You must set the price of the Trailing Stop Order below the current price.
 The trailing price will go up with the share price but will not go down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For instance, you bought shares of IBRK at 30 USD.
 They are now at 40 USD.
 You want to sell if they fall back below 35 USD.
 You set a Trailing Stop Sell Order at a price of 35 USD and with a trailing
 amount of 5 USD.
 If the price increases to 42 USD, the trailing price will rise to 37 USD.
 If the price decreases to 38 USD, the trailing price will stay at 37 USD.
 Now, if the price recovers and goes all the way to 50 USD, the trailing
 stop will now be at 45 USD.
 If the price goes below 45 USD, your broker will generate a Market Order
 and this will sell your shares at the market price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other usage is when you have a short position of some shares.
 And you want to sell if the market goes up again.
 A Trailing Stop Buy Order works exactly the same way but with a reverse
 direction.
 The price must be above the current price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Trailing Stop Order can be a powerful tool.
 But this is not generally something you are going to use if you are in
 the for the long-term.
 This is more a tool for active traders and for people who trade in single
 shares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Trailing Stop Order also exists in a Trailing Stop Limit Order variant.
 This is exactly the same difference as for the Stop Order And Stop Limit
 Order.
 Instead of submitting a Market Order, it will submit a Limit Order.

Call options differ from forward contracts in that calls have unlimited
 upside potential and limited downside potential, whereas the gains and
 losses from a forward contract are both unlimited.
 Therefore, since call options do not have the downside potential of forwards,
 they represent only the “good half” (the upside potential) of the forward
 contract.
 The “bad half” of the long forward position is the unlimited downside potential
 that is equivalent to being short a put.
 This is consistent with put-call parity where being long a call and short
 a put yields the same payoff as a forward contract.

 With so many people waiting for others to make the first move, it's amazing

 happen to go up.
 Success is one thing, but it's more important not to look bad if you fail.
 There's an unwritten rule on Wall Street: "You'll never lost your job losing
 your client's money in IBM." Also, there are various funds restrictions
 set by SEC, such as: they cannot own more than 10% of the shares in any
 given company, nor more than 5% of fund's assets in any given stock, or

Because of the collective efforts of these participants, information is
 reflected fully and immediately in the market price of each asset.
 And because market participants will move instantly to buy any asset that's
 too cheap or sell one that's too dear, assets are priced fairly in the
 absolute and relative to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thus, market prices represent accurate estimates of assets' intrinsic value,
 and no participant can consistently identify and profit from instances
 when they are wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assets therefore sell at prices from which they can be expected to deliver
 risk-adjusted returns that are "fair" relative to other assets.
 Riskier assets must offer higher returns in order to attract buyers.
 The market will set prices so that appears to be the case, but it won't
 provide a "free lunch".
 That is, there will be no incremental return that is not related to (and
 compensatory for) incremental risk.

All information is immediately reflected in stock prices as soon as it becomes
 available so that there is no way for an investor to get market-beating
 returns.
 Depending which form of efficiency you believe exits, you can decide on
 an investment strategy philosophy:

Weak form - the current stock price reflects the information contained in
 all past prices.
 Implication - charts and technical analysis that use past prices alone
 would not be useful in finding undervalued stocks.
 If you believe in this one, you might use charts and technical analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Semi-strong form - the current stock price reflects the information contained
 not only in past prices but all public information (including financial
 statements and news reports) and no approach that was predicated on using
 and massaging this information would be useful in finding undervalued stocks.
 If you believe in this one, you can still use 10k reports and private informati
on and find undervalued stocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Strong form - the current stock price reflects all the public and private
 information.
 Because even when the insiders trade, it pushes up/down the stock price.
 Implication - even insiders can't beat the market.

Seth Klarman's opinion - most of these characteristics are not permanent.
 Something broadly accepted can become controversial or even taboo.
 Information can become more or less available.
 Thus, an asset class deemed close to efficient at one point may become
 quite inefficient at another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Paul Johnson's opinion - Inverting these conditions yields a test of market
 inefficiency.
 For instance, if an asset is not widely known and broadly followed, it
 might be inefficiently priced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Howard Marks's opinion - he used to use word efficient, but in the sense
 of "speedy, quick to incorporate information", not "right".
 He agrees that because investors work hard to evaluate every new piece
 of information, asset prices immediately reflect the consensus view of
 information's significance.
 He do not, however, believe the consensus view is necessarily correct.
 According to him, however, some asset classes are quite efficient.
 In most of these:

the asset class is widely known and has a broad following
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the class is socially acceptable, not controversial or taboo 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the merits of the class are clear and comprehensible, at least on the surface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
information about the class and its components is distributed widely and
 evenly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to him, an inefficient market is one that is market by at least
 one of the following characteristics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Market prices are often wrong.
 Because access to information and the analysis thereof are highly imperfect,
 market prices are often far above or far below intrinsic values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The risk-adjusted return on one asset class can be far out of line with
 those of other asset classes.
 Because assets are often valued at other-than-fair prices, an asset class
 can deliver a risk-adjusted return that is significantly too high (a free
 lunch) or too low relative to other asset classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some investors can consistently outperform others.
 Because of the existence of a) significant misvaluations and b) differences
 among participants in terms of skill, insight and information access, it
 is possible for misvaluations to be identified and profited from with regularit
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marks concluded that no market is completely efficient or inefficient and
 it's just a matter of degree.
 He strongly believes that mainstream securities markets can be so efficient
 that it's largely a waste of time to work at finding winners there.
 Inefficiency is a necessary condition for superior investing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory should inform our decisions but not dominate them.
 If we entirely ignore theory we can make big mistakes.
 We can fool ourselves into thinking it's possible to know more than everyone
 else and to regularly beat heavily populated markets.
 We can buy securities for their returns but ignore their risk.
 We can buy 50 correlated securities and mistakenly think we've diversified.

Aswath Damodaran's opinion - market goes through cycles of inefficiencies
 and efficiencies.
 Sometimes it is very inefficient and sometimes it gets more efficient.
 He believes that markets are most efficient to most people at most times.
 Markets are composed of human beings that have to believe that they can
 beat the market for markets to become efficient.
 He believes that there are some inefficiencies that are created partly
 by trading costs, by information problems, and by behavioral factors.
 And our job as investors is to find out these little inefficiencies.

Market Efficiency is a model, not a reality.
 Real life markets cannot be perfectly efficient.

Peter Lynch also found it difficult to integrate the efficient-market hypothesis
 (that everything in the stock market is

known
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and prices are always 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) with the random-walk hypothesis (that the ups and downs of the market
 are irrational and entirely unpredictable).
 It's very hard to support the popular academic theory that the market is
 irrational when you know somebody who just made a twenty-fold profit in
 a stock and could explain in advance why the stock was going to rise.

Philip Fisher's opinion (Fisher refers to strong efficiency)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This concept holds that at any one time the market “efficient” prices are
 assumed to reflect fully and realistically all that is known about the
 company.
 Unless someone has some significant, illicit inside information, there
 is no way genuine bargains can be found, since the favorable influences
 that make a potential buyer believe that an attractive situation exists
 are already reflected in the price of stock!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Efficient market theory grew out of the academic School of Random Walkers.
 These people found that it was difficult to identify technical trading
 strategies that worked well enough after transactions costs to provide
 an attractive profit relative to the risks taken.
 Fisher doesn't disagree with this.
 Fisher believed that it is very, very tough to make money with in and out
 trading based on short-term market forecasts.
 Perhaps the market is efficient in this narrow sense of the word.

Warren Buffett's opinion: amazingly, EMT was embraced not only by academics,
 but by many investment professionals and corporate managers as well.
 Observing correctly that the market was frequently efficient, they went
 on to conclude incorrectly that it was always efficient.
 The difference between these propositions is night and day.
