Valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Refresh a company's financials and details quarterly.
 
\series default
Peter Lynch - every few months it's worthwhile to recheck the company story.
 This may involve reading latest analysis or quarterly reports, and inquiring
 about the earnings and whether the earnings are holding up as expected.
 With fast growers, especially, you have to ask yourself what will keep
 them growing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start with Aswath Damodaran, a Professor of Finance at New York University
, where he teaches corporate finance and equity valuation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Value rests on standard ingredients: cash flows, growth and risk, though
 the effects of each vary across companies and across time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No matter what type of company you are valuing, you have to decide whether
 you are valuing just equity or the entire business, the approach you will
 use to estimate value (intrinsic versus relative valuation), and the key
 components of value.
 If you value the business, you can get to the value of equity by adding
 back assets that you have not valued yet (cash and cross holdings) and
 subtracting out what you owe (debt).
 The choice matters because all of your inputs - cash flows, growth, and
 risk - have to be defined consistently.
 Aswath Damodaran valued the businesses and backed into the value of equity.
 With financial service firms, our inability to define debt and estimate
 cash flows push us into using equity valuation models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Well done valuations based upon better information should generate better
 returns than shoddy valuations based upon rumor or worse.
 The second is market feedback.
 To make money on even the best-done valuation, the market has to correct
 its mistakes.
 In more selfish terms, you want the market to be efficient for the most
 part, with pockets of inefficiency that you can exploit.
 There is also a factor of luck.
 While this will violate your sense of fairness, luck can overwhelm good
 valuation skills.
 While you cannot depend on good luck, you can reduce the impact of luck
 on your returns by spreading your bets across many companies that you have
 found to be undervalued.
 Diversification still pays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Growth is not free and is not always good for value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All good things, including growth, come to an end.
 Nothing is forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Look at the past but think about the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remember the law of large numbers.
 An average is better than a single number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accept uncertainty, face up to it and deal with it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you cannot analyze/valuate a company and/or cannot predict what will
 happen with its business in the future, skip the given business and find
 one you can figure out.
 Because otherwise you are just guessing - there is nothing wrong with some
 guessing, but make conservative guesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Convert stories to numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Valuation gives you a lifevest, that's all what it is.
 It gives you something to hold on to when everybody else changes their
 mind and go another direction.
 It's not gonna stop you from doing really stupid things - if you really
 want to buy something, you'll find a way to buy it.
 The same for selling.
 Valuation slows the process down.
 It gives you rationale side of the argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most people don't believe in valuation (even ones whose use valuation for
 living).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Three rules of valuation:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Valuation is simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Every valuation has a story, a narrative behind it; a good valuation is
 more about the story that it is about the numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When valuations go bad it's not because of the numbers, it's because of
 3 problems: bias (wrong assumptions we made), uncertainty, and complexity
 (of the world and models).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you see someone else's valuation, you have to check who did it and who
 paid for it.
 Another thing it that when you do a valuation, you are using numbers.
 But they are estimates.
 There is a great deal of uncertainty.
 They are always gonna be wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All valuations are biased.
 You almost never start valuing a company or stock with a blank slate.
 All too often, your views on a company or stock are formed before you start
 inputting the numbers into the models and metrics that you use and, not
 surprisingly, your conclusions tend to reflect your biases.
 Confine your background research on the company to information sources
 rather than opinion sources; in other words, spend more time looking at
 a company's financial statements than reading equity research reports about
 the company.
 If you are looking at someone else's valuation of a company, always consider
 the reasons for the valuation and the potential biases that may affect
 the analyst's judgments.
 As a general rule, the more bias there is in the process, the less weight
 you should attach to the valuation judgment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most valuations (even good ones) are wrong.
 One thin is estimation error, about the future of a business, which is
 firm-specific uncertainty, resulting in earnings and cash flows will be
 different from your estimates.
 Finally, even if a firm evolves exactly the way you expected it to, the
 macroeconomic environment can change in unpredictable ways.
 Also, collecting more information and doing more analysis will not necessarily
 translate into less uncertainty.
 In some cases, ironically, it can generate more uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Smaller models are better.
 Complex models are black boxes - are you running a model or a model is
 running you? Complex models got lots of numbers - garbage in, garbage out.
 If you can valuate company with 3 numbers, don't use fourth.
 Less is more.
 Simpler can be better.
 Valuations have become more and more complex over the last two decades,
 as a consequence of two developments.
 Computers and calculators are more powerful and accessible than they used
 to be, making it easier to analyze data.
 On the other side, information is both plentiful and easier to access and
 use.
 More detail gives you a chance to use specific information to make better
 forecasts, but it also creates the need for more inputs, with the potential
 for error on each one, and it generates more complicated and opaque models.
 When valuing an asset, use the simplest model that you can.
 If you can value an asset with 3 inputs, don't use 5.
 If you can value a company with three years of forecasts, forecasting 10
 years of cash flows is asking for trouble.
 Less is more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't stop trying.
 Most investors choose not to value companies and offer a variety of excuses:
 valuation models are too complex, there is insufficient information, or
 there is too much uncertainty.
 While all of these reasons have a kernel of truth to them, there is no
 reason why they should stop you from trying.
 Valuation models can be simplified and - yes - the future will always be
 uncertain.
 Will you be wrong sometimes? Of course, but so will everyone else.
 Success in investing comes not from being right but from being wrong less
 often than everyone else.

(Graham) There is no truth more fundamental in investment that the simple
 statement that dividends and market value are the only concrete returns
 which a public stockholder ever gets for the money he puts into a company.
 Earnings, financial strength, increased asset values - all these may be

Expense categorization
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Operating expenses: 
\emph default
these, at least in theory, provide benefits only for the current period;
 the cost of labor and materials expended to create products that are sold
 in the current period is a good example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Financing expenses: 
\emph default
these are arising from the non-equity financing used to raise capital for
 the business; the most common example is interest expenses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Capital expenses:
\emph default
 these are expected to generate benefits over multiple periods; for instance,
 the cost of buying machinery and buildings is treated as a capital expense,
 and is spread over time as depreciation or amortization.
 Netting operating expenses and depreciation from revenues yields operating
 income, whereas the income after interest and taxes is termed net income.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Accrual accounting
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Accrual accounting is an accounting method where revenue or expenses are
 recorded when a transaction occurs rather than when payment is received
 or made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method follows the matching principle, which says that revenues and
 expenses should be recognized in the same period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accrual accounting is the opposite of cash accounting, which recognizes
 transactions only when there is an exchange of cash.
 Accrual accounting is almost always required for companies that carry inventory
 or make sales on credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Consider a consulting company that provides a $5,000 service to a client
 on Oct.
 30.
 The client receives the bill for services rendered and makes a cash payment
 on Nov.
 25.
 The entry of this transaction will be recorded differently under the cash
 and accrual methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The revenue generated by the consulting services will only be recognized
 under the cash method when the company receives payment.
 A company that uses the cash accounting method will record $5,000 revenue
 on Nov.
 25.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accrual accounting, however, says that the cash method is not accurate because
 it is likely, if not certain, that the company will receive the cash at
 some point in the future because the services have been provided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The accrual method recognizes the revenue when the clients' services are
 concluded even though the cash payment is not yet in the bank.
 Revenue will be recognized as earned on Oct.
 30.
 The sale is booked to an account known as accounts receivable, found in
 the current assets section of the balance sheet.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Accounts receivable 
\emph default
- amounts owed by customers to the company.
 It's all the sales the company booked on credit.
 This change in AR shows how well the company is doing collecting cash on
 those sales or selling more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Accounts payable
\emph default
 - amounts owed by the company to suppliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Depreciation
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It is an annual expense a company takes to account for using up its long-term
 assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Example, a factory may cost millions to build but can only produce for 20
 years.
 To match the expense of building with the product sales produced, the company
 takes 1/20th of the building cost off as an expense each year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So depreciation is used for physical assets.
 Amortization is the same concept but used for intangible assets like patents
 and goodwill.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Aswath Damodaran use to recalculate a few expenses that are according to
 him consistently miscategorized in financial statements:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Operating leases are considered as operating expenses by accountants but
 they are really financial expenses.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
adjusted operating earnings = operating earnings + operating lease expense
 - depreciation on the leased asset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the effects of capitalizing operating leases - debt will increase leading
 to an increase in debt ratios used in the cost of capital and levered beta,
 operating income will also increase since operating leases will now be
 before the imputed interest on the operating lease expense, net income
 will be unaffected since it is both after operating and financial expenses
 anyway, and return on capital will generally decrease 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
R&D expenses are considered as operating expenses by accountants but they
 are really capital expenses.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
specify the period in which you are gonna capitalize the R&D (from R&D to
 commercial project, 2-10 years for example)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
collect past R&D expenses for as long as the amortizable life from step
 1) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
sum up the unamortized R&D expenses from step 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of capitalizing R&D expenses - operating income will generally
 increase, though it depends upon whether R&D is growing or not.
 if it is flat, there will be no effect since the amortization will offset
 R&D added back.
 The faster R&D is growing the more operating income will be affected.
 Net income will increase proportionately, depending again upon how fast
 R&D is growing.
 Book value of equity (and capital) will increase by the capitalized research
 asset.
 The return on capital & equity will generally go down.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Most common Income Statement adjustments:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Adjust revenues for incomplete contracts, rebates and returns.

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Balance Sheet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are assets, liabilities and stockholder's equity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It can be worth to look at (in assets): cash and cash equivalents, short
 and long term investments = add those 3 together, and subtract short and
 long term debt and if a company is worth investing, we can see if it's
 more in debt or in profit (there is at least 3-4 times more profit than
 debt).
 So we are looking for a company that is a cash-rich, has a long term investment
s, and doesn't have too much debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a company has weak balance sheet, it can run out of business in case
 that something bad happens in the future.
 This is bankruptcy, and you can potentially lose all your money.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(Aswath Damodaran) A note on a goodwill: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You can usually find it in accounting balance sheet → intangible assets
 → goodwill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
According to Damodaran, goodwill is the most useless asset known.
 If you are the greatest company in the world and you've grown entirely
 with internal investments, there will be no goodwill on your balance sheet.
 The minute you do an acquisition, goodwill pops up - because balance sheet
 has to be balanced.
 Goodwill is a plug variable.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Difference between basic an diluted shares is that diluted shares number
 is slightly higher, because those shares don't yet exist - they will be
 created as a compensation to directors of a company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a company invests in the securities or assets of another company, the
 investment is valued at an updated market value if the investment is held
 for trading and historical cost when it is not.
 In the special case where the holding comprises more than 50% of the value
 of another company (subsidiary), the firm has to record all of the subsidiary's
 assets and liabilities on its balance sheet (this is called consolidation)
 with a minority interest item capturing the percentage of the subsidiary
 that does not belong to it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One clear lesson from Buffett's discussions of financial information is
 that accounting has inherent limits, even though it is absolutely essential.
 Despite enormous managerial leeway in reporting earnings and potential
 abuse, financial information can be of great use to investors.
 Buffett uses it every day, and has allocated billions of dollars doing
 it.
 So it is possible to make important investment decisions on the basis of
 available financial information if one exercises knowledgeable judgment.
 That judgment may include making adjustments to determine look-through
 earnings, owner earnings and intrinsic value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mergers: when a company is acquired, GAAP currently condone two very different
 ways of recording the transaction: "purchase" and "pooling".
 In pooling, stock must be the currency; in a purchase, payment can be made
 in either cash or stock.
 Whatever the currency, managements usually detest purchase accounting because
 it almost always requires that a "goodwill" account be established and
 subsequently written off - a process that saddles earnings with a large
 annual charge that normally persists for decades.
 In contrast, pooling avoids a goodwill account, which is why managements
 love it.
 Pooling is grounded in the poetic notion that when two rivers merge their
 streams become indistinguishable.
 Under this concept, a company that has been merged into a larger enterprise
 has not been "purchased" (even though it will often have received a large
 "sell-out" premium).
 Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those pesky subsequent charges
 to earnings are eliminated.
 Instead, the accounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses
 had forever been one unit.
 But the reality is far different: there is indisputably an acquirer and
 an acquiree, and the latter has been "purchased", no matter how the deal
 has been structured.
 Just ask employees severed from their jobs which company was the conqueror
 and which was the conquered.
 You will find no confusion.
 Yes, there are some true "mergers of equals", but they are few and far
 between.

Buffett emphasizes that useful financial statements must enable a user to
 answer 3 basic questions about a business:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
approximately how much a company is worth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
its likely ability to meet its future obligations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Buffett laments that GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) conventions
 make these determinations difficult, and indeed almost any accounting system
 will be hard pressed to furnish completely accurate answers given the complexit
ies of business.
 Acknowledging the monumental difficulty of investing an accounting system
 superior to GAAP, Buffett articulates a range of concept that go a longer
 way toward making financial information useful to investors and managers.

"GAAP accounting lets us reflect in our net worth the up-to-date underlying
 values of the businesses we partially own, but does not let us reflect
 their underlying earnings in our income account.
 In the case of our controlled companies, just the opposite is true.
 Here, we show full earnings in our income account but never change asset
 values on our balance sheet, no matter how much the value of a business
 might have increased since we purchased it.
 Our mental approach to this accounting schizophrenia is to ignore GAAP
 figures and to focus solely on the future earning power of both our controlled
 and non-controlled businesses.
 Using this approach, we establish our own ideas of business value, keeping
 these independent from both the accounting values shown on our books for
 controlled companies and the values placed by a sometimes foolish market
 on or partially owned companies.
 It is this business value that we hope to increase at a reasonable (or,
 preferably, unreasonable) rate in the years ahead."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is common on Wall Street to value businesses using a calculation of cash
 flows equal to a) operating earnings plus b) depreciation expense and other
 non-cash charges.
 Buffett regards that calculation is incomplete.
 After taking a) operating earnings and adding back b) non-cash charges,
 Buffett argues that you must then subtract something else: c) required
 reinvestment in the business.
 Buffett defines c) as "the average amount of capitalized expenditures for
 plant and equipment, etc.
 that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive
 position and its unit volume." Buffett calls the result of a)+b)-c) "owner
 earnings." 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When b) and c) differ, cash flow analysis and owner earnings analysis differ
 too.
 For most businesses, c) usually exceeds b), so cash flow analysis usually
 overstates economic reality.
 In all cases where c) differs from b), calculation of owner earnings enables
 one to appraise performance more accurately than would analysis of GAAP
 earnings, or cash flows affected by purchase price accounting adjustments.
 That is why Berkshire supplementally reports owner earnings for its acquired
 businesses, rather than rely solely on GAAP earnings figures, or cash flow
 figures.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Common yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings
 or to book value, and even growth rates have nothing to do with valuation
 except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash
 flows into and from the business.
 Indeed, the growth can destroy value if it requires cash inputs in the
 early years of a project or enterprise that exceed the discounted value
 of the cash that those assets will generate in later years.
 Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to "growth"
 and "value" styles as contrasting approaches to investment are displaying
 their ignorance, not their sophistication.
 Growth is simply a component - usually a plus, sometimes a minus - in the
 value equation.

Warren Buffett On Accounting Shenanigans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What needs to be reported is data - whether GAAP, non-GAAP, or extra-GAAP
 - that helps financially literate readers answer three key questions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Approximately how much is this company worth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is the likelihood that it can meet its future obligations?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How good a job are its managers doing, given the hand they have been dealt?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most cases, answers to one or more of these questions are somewhere between
 difficult and impossible to glean from the minimum GAAP presentation.
 The business world is simply too complex for a single set of rules to effective
ly describe economic reality for all enterprises, particularly those operating
 in a wide variety of businesses, such as Berkshire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further complicating the problem is the fact that many managements view
 GAAP not as a standard to be met, but as an obstacle to overcome.
 Even honest and well-intentioned managements sometimes stretch GAAP a bit
 in order to present figures they think will more appropriately describe
 their performance.
 Both the smoothing of earnings and the "big bath" quarter are "white lie"
 techniques employed by otherwise upright managements.
 And then there are managers who actively use GAAP to deceive and defraud.

\emph on
 "It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with
 a gun."

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The ultimate point to understand about accounting is that it is a form.
 As a form, it can be manipulated.
 GAAP has enough trouble.
 Yet two groups of people make it worse: those who try to overcome GAAP
 requirements by stretching their accounting imagination, and those who
 deliberately employ GAAP to facilitate financial fraud.
 The former is especially hard to deal with, as Buffett suggests in illustrating
 how debate on accounting for stock options reveals the parochialism of
 many executives and accountants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, criticizing the view against treating stock options as expenses
 when granted, Buffett delivers this laconic argument: "If options aren't
 a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense,
 what is? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings,
 where in the world should they go?" So far, he has gotten no answers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The quest for integrity in financial reporting is endless.
 The latest product to catch on is accounting for "restructurings", a label
 given to a whole range of maneuvers that enable managers to engage in age-old
 earnings management and smoothing techniques with greater felicity and
 deftness than ever before.
 Other examples concern estimates required when calculating pension liabilities
 and the timing of sales of assets that generate gains or losses to influence
 reported earnings.
 Investors beware.

Net Income: it may be an important number at most companies, but it's almost
 always meaningless at Berkshire.
 Regardless of how Berkshire's businesses might be doing, Buffett could
 - quite legally - cause net income in any given period to be almost any
 number they would like.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
They have that flexibility because 
\emph on
realized gains
\emph default
 or losses on investments go into the net income figure, whereas *unrealized
 gains* (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded.
 For example, imagine that Berkshire had a $10 billion increase in unrealized
 gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses.
 The net income - which would count only the loss - would be reported as
 less than the operating income.
 If they had meanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might
 proclaim that the earnings were down X% when in reality the business might
 be much improved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Operating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonabl

Harry Markowitz - he noted that the risk of a portfolio could be written
 as a function not only of how much was invested in each security and the
 risk of the individual securities, but also of how these securities moved
 together.
 If securities that move in different directions are in the same portfolio,
 he noted that the risk of the portfolio could be lower than the risk of
 individual securities, and that investors should get a much better trade-off
 from taking risk by holding diversified portfolios than by holding individual
 stocks.
 Let's say that the only risk you care about is the risk that you cannot
 diversify away.
 Macroeconomic risk that affects many or most firms cannot be diversified
 away.

Since there is no cost to diversifying and no gain from not doing so, each

 assets (called the market portfolio).

The beta is a relative risk measure and it is standardized around 1; a stock

This is an alternative to GAAP rules governing investments in marketable
 securities of the investee less than 20%, this measures the investor's
 economic performance based on its percentage interest of the investee's
 undistributed earnings (after an incremental reduction for income taxes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generally accepted accounting principles require (but there are exceptions)
 full consolidation of sales, expenses, taxes, and earnings of business
 holdings more than 50% owned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Full inclusion of underlying earnings from another class of holdings, companies
 owned 20% to 50% (usually called "invest-tees"), also normally occurs.
 Earnings from such companies are included via a one-line entry in the owner's
 Statement of Earnings.
 Unlike the over-50% category, all items of revenue and expense are omitted;
 just the proportional share of net income is included.
 Thus, if Corporation A owns 1/3 of Corporation B, 1/3 of B's earnings,
 whether or not distributed by B, will end up in A's earnings.
 JFYI, there are also some modifications, both in this and the over-50%
 category, for intercorporate taxes and purchase price adjustments.

Accounting goodwill: the amount by which the purchase price of a business
 exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired (after deducting liabilities).
 It is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and then amortized as an
 annual expense, usually over 40 years.
 So accounting goodwill assigned to that business decreases over time by
 the aggregate amount of that expense.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Economic goodwill: this is something else.
 It is the combination of intangible assets, like brand name recognition,
 that enable a business to produce earnings on tangible assets, like plant
 and equipment, in excess of average rates.
 The amount of economic goodwill is the capitalized value of that excess.
 Economic goodwill tends to increase over time, at least nominally in proportion
 to inflation for mediocre businesses, and more than that for businesses
 with solid economic or franchise characteristics.
 Indeed, businesses with more economic goodwill relative to tangible assets
 are hurt far less by inflation than businesses with less of that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These differences between accounting goodwill and economic goodwill entail
 the following insights.
 First, the best guide to the value of a business's economic goodwill is
 what it can earn on unleveraged net tangible assets, excluding charges
 for amortization of goodwill.
 Therefore when a business acquires other businesses, and the acquisitions
 are reflected in an asset account called goodwill, analysis of that business
 should ignore the amortization charges.
 Second, since economic goodwill should be measured at its full economic
 cost, i.e., before amortization, evaluation of a possible business acquisition
 should be conducted without regard to those amortization charges as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buffett emphasizes, however, that the same does not hold for depreciation
 charges - these should not be ignored because they are real economic costs.
 He makes this point in explaining why Berkshire always shows its shareholders
 the results of operations with respect to acquired businesses net of any
 purchase price adjustments GAAP requires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Berkshire's intrinsic business value considerably exceeds book value.
 There are two major reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Standard accounting principles require that common stocks held by our insurance
 subsidiaries be stated on our books at market value, but that other stocks
 we own be carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
More important, Berkshire owns several businesses that possess economic
 goodwill (which is properly includable in intrinsic business value) far
 larger than the accounting goodwill that is carried on our balance sheet
 and reflected in book value.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Businesses logically are worth far more than net tangible assets when they
 can be expected to produce earnings on such assets considerably in excess
 of market rates of return.
 The capitalized value of this excess return is economic goodwill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For years the traditional wisdom held that inflation protection was best
 provided by businesses with natural resources, plants and machinery, or
 other tangible assets ("In Goods We Trust").
 It doesn't work that way.
 Asset-heavy businesses generally earn low rates of return - rates that
 often barely provide enough capital to fund the inflationary needs of the
 existing business, with nothing left over for real growth, for distribution
 to owners, or for acquisition of new businesses.
 In contrast, a disproportionate number of the great business fortunes built
 up during the inflationary years arose from ownership of operations that
 combined intangibles of lasting value with relatively minor requirements
 for tangible assets.
 In such cases earnings have bounded upward in nominal dollars, and these
 dollars have been largely available for the acquisition of additional businesse
s.
 This phenomenon has been particularly evident in the communications business.
 That business has required little in the way of tangible investment - yet
 its franchises have endured.
 During inflation, goodwill is the gift that keeps giving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized - that is, written off - over a period
 no longer than 40 years.
 Therefore, when Berkshire acquired the half of GEICO for $1.6 billion, to
 extinguish this GEICO goodwill, they annually take charges or about $40
 million against their earnings.
 In accounting sense, consequently their GEICO goodwill will disappear gradually
 in even-sized bites.
 But the economic goodwill they have purchased at GEICO will not decline
 in the same measured way.
 In fact, Buffett's best guess is that the economic goodwill assignable
 to GEICO will not decline at all, but rather will increase - and probably
 in a very substantial way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investors are often led astray by CEOs and Wall Street analysts who equate
 depreciation charges with the amortization charges.
 In no way are the two the same: With rare exceptions, depreciation is an
 economic cost every bit as real as wages, materials, or taxes.
 Buffett doesn't think that so-called EBITDA is a meaningful measure of
 performance.
 Managements that dismiss the importance of depreciation - and emphasize
 "cash flow" or EBITDA - are apt to make faulty decisions, and you should
 keep that in mind as you make your own investment decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When Company A acquires Company B, then Company B has higher balance sheet
 figures, which produces the lower income figures in the earnings statement.
 This is the result of the asset write-ups and of the fact that some of
 the written-up assets must be depreciated or amortized.
 The higher the asset figure, the higher the annual depreciation or amortization
 charge to earnings must be.
 There can be:

 stock of Company B before of after the acquisition? And, if business is
 worth some given multiple of earnings, was Company B worth considerably
 more the day before the acquisition than it was worth the following day?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buffett has an answer for these questions - "owner's earnings".
 It represent:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
a) reported earnings 
\series bold
PLUS

b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges
 such as 4 items in the list above 
\series bold
MINUS 
\series default
c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment
, etc that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive
 position and its unit volume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures
 provided by GAAP since c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult
 to make.
 Despite this problem, Buffett considers the owner earnings figure, not
 the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both
 for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the owner earnings is a better measure of economic performance than cash
 flow or GAAP earnings, equal to a) operating earnings plus b) depreciation
 and other non-cash charges minus c) required reinvestment in a business
 to maintain present competitive position and unit volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach produces owner-earnings for Company B before and after the
 acquisition that are identical, which means valuations are also identical,
 just as common sense would tell you should be the case.
 This result is reached because the sum of a) and b) is the same in both
 columns before and after the acquisition, and because c) is necessarily
 the same in both cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When c) exceeds b) - GAAP earnings overstate owner earnings.
 Frequently this overstatement is substantial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this points up the absurdity of the "cash flow" numbers that are often
 set forth in Wall Street reports.
 These numbers routinely include a) plus b) - but do not subtract c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Cash Flow", true, may serve as a shorthand of some utility in descriptions
 of certain real estate businesses or other enterprises that make huge initial
 outlays and only tiny outlays thereafter.
 A company whose only holding is a bridge or an extremely long-lived gas
 field would be an example.
 But "cash flow" is meaningless in such businesses as manufacturing, retailing,
 extractive companies, and utilities because for them, c) is always significant.
 To be sure, businesses of this kind may in a given year be able to defer
 capital spending.
 But over a 5- or 10-year period, they must make the investment - or the
 business decays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why, then, are "cash flow" numbers so popular today? Buffett believes these
 numbers are frequently used by marketers of businesses and securities in
 attempts to justify the unjustifiable (and therefore to sell what should
 be unsaleable).
 When a) - that is, GAAP earnings - looks by itself inadequate to service
 debt of a junk bond or justify a foolish stock price, how convenient it
 becomes for salesmen to focus on a) + b).
 But you shouldn't add b) without subtracting c): though dentists correctly
 claim that if you ignore your teeth they'll go away, the same is not true
 for c).
 The company or investor believing that the debt-servicing ability or the
 equity valuation of an enterprise can be measured by totaling a) and b)
 while ignoring c) is headed for certain trouble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Questioning GAAP figures may seem impious to some.
 After all, what are we paying the accountants for if it is not to deliver

Some important numbers worth to have a look on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(Peter Lynch) Lynch uses profit before taxes, also known as the pretax profit
 margin, as a tool for analyzing companies.
 That's what's left of a company's annual sales dollar after all the costs,
 including depreciation and interest expenses, have been deducted.
 For example, Fort Motor in 1987 had sales of $71.6 billion and earned $7.38
 billion pretax, for a pretax profit margin of 10.3%.
 Retailers have lower profit margins than manufacturers, an outstanding
 supermarket can have only 3-4% pretax.
 You have to compare it within the same industries.
 The company with the highest profit margin is by definition the lowest-cost
 operator, and low-cost operator has a better change of surviving if business
 conditions deteriorate.
 What you want is a relatively high profit-margin in a long-term stock that
 you plan to hold through good times and bad, and a relatively low profit-margin
 in a successful turnaround.

P/E Ratio - as detailed above.
 So, it's fairly priced if its equal its growth rate of earnings.
 If a company's P/E is less than the growth rate, it may be a bargain.
 On the other hand, if P/E is higher than the growth rate, it is an unattractive
 prospect and it's headed for a comedown.
 In general, P/E that's half the growth rate is very positive, and one that's
 twice the growth rate is very negative.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Another formula enables us to compare growth rates to earnings, while also
 taking the dividends into account.

\begin_layout Itemize
The cash position.
 Calculate cash net of long-term debt.
 When a company is sitting on billions in cash, it's definitely something
 you want to know about.
 It's good to try to find out what a company will do with excessive cash,
 if it has lots of it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The debt factor.
 How much does the company owe, and how much does it own? Debt versus (stockhold
er's) equity.
 A normal corporate balance sheet has 75% equity and 25% debt.
 Weak balance sheet might have 80% debt and 20% equity.
 Especially among turnarounds and troubled companies, Lynch pays special
 attention to the debt factor.
 It's debt that determines which companies will survive and which will go
 bankrupt in a crisis.
 Young companies with heavy debts are always at risk.
 Also, it's the kind of debt as much as the actual amount, that separates
 the winners from the losers in a crisis.
 There's bank debt and there's funded debt.
 Bank debt is the worst kind, and is due on demand.
 It doesn't have to come from a bank.
 It can also take the form of commercial paper, which is loaned from one
 company to another for short periods of time.
 The important thing is that it's due very soon, and sometimes even "due
 on call".
 That means that the lender can ask for his money back at the first sign
 of trouble.
 If the borrower can't pay back the money, it can be very dangerous to sharehold
ers.
 Funded debt is the best kind, from shareholder's point of view, and it
 can never be called in no matter how bleak the situation, as long as the
 borrower continues to pay the interest.
 The principal may not be due for 15, 20, or 30 years.
 It usually takes the form of regular corporate bonds with long maturities.
 Corporate bonds may be upgraded or downgraded by the rating agencies depending
 on the financial health of the company, but whatever happens, the bondholders
 cannot demand immediate repayment of principal the way a bank can.
 Sometimes even interest payments can be deferred.
 Funded debt gives companies time to wiggle out of trouble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dividends.
 The real issue can be, how the dividend or the lack of a dividend affects
 the value of a company and the price of its stock over time.
 One strong argument in favor of companies that pay dividends is that companies
 that don't pay dividends have a sorry history of blowing the money on a
 string of stupid diworsifications.
 Another argument in favor of dividend-paying stocks is that the presence
 of the dividend can keep the stock price from falling as far as it would
 if there were no dividend.
 That can be a reason why to keep some starwarts and even slow growers in
 the portfolio.
 If you plan to buy a stock for its dividend, find out if the company is
 going to be able to pay it during recessions and bad times.
 A company with 20 or 30-year record of regularly raising the dividend is
 your best bet.
 Cyclicals are not always reliable dividend-payers.

Earnings per Share - The problem with EPS is that it's subject to manipulation

 Every company knows that investors examine earnings.

 Some companies use different accounting methods.
 But it still remains a useful measurement.
 If the company's earnings per share increases quarter after quarter at
 a faster rate, that's called earnings momentum or earnings acceleration
 and is a popular way of identifying solid growth companies.
 Some of the best performing mutual fund managers use momentum investing

\begin_layout Itemize
P/E Ratio - use a stock's P/E to determine how much you're paying for a
 company's earnings power.
 If the P/E is high, you should expect to get high earnings growth for the
 extra money you paid for the stock.
 It's riskier to invest in a high P/E stock than a low P/E because it's
 more difficult for the high P/E to meet the high earnings expectations
 of its shareholders and analysts.
 Companies with low P/E ratios usually operate in slow-growth industries.
 Also, mature companies with low P/E ratios often pay dividends while new
 companies with high P/E ratios usually do not.

P/S Ratio - simply take the company's total market value and divide it by
 the most recent four quarters of sales revenue.
 Common objection of using PSR is "it's profits I care about, not sales",

 They use accounting rules that are flexible to interpret how much it costs
 them to do business and then subtract that number fro revenue to get earnings.

 Now, $150.05/$8.82=$17.01.
 This means, that you would need to invest 17.01 dollars for 1 dollar in

 By doing this, you can determine whether or not shares of a given company

The earning power should ordinarily represent an estimate of average earnings
 for the next 5 years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The above estimate should be developed preferably from a projection of the
 dollar volume and the profit margin.
 The starting point is the actual exhibit over some period in the past.
 Under conditions existing in early 1949 there is no "normal period" of
 past years which can be accepted as a direct measure of future earning
 power.
 However, an averaging of the results of an unusually good period and a
 subnormal period might be acceptable - for example, giving 50% weight to
 the 1936-40 average after taxes and 50% weight to 1947-48 or 1946-48.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When figures of earlier years enter into the calculation, proper adjustment
 should be made for subsequent changes in capitalization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The multiplier should reflect prospective longer-term changes in earnings.
 A multiplier of 12 is suitable for stocks with neutral prospects.
 Increases or decreases from this figure must depend on the judgment and
 preferences of the appraiser.
 In all but the most exceptional cases, however, the maximum multiplier
 should be 20 and the minimum should be 8.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the tangible-asset value is less than the earning-power value (earning
 power * multiplier), the latter may be reduced by some arbitrary factor
 to reflect this deficiency.
 Graham's suggested factor is as follows: deduct 1/4 of the amount by which
 the earning-power value exceeds twice the asset value.
\end_layout

If the net-current-asset value exceeds the earning-power value, the latter
 may be increased by 50% of the excess raised value.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Where extraordinary conditions prevail - such as war profits or war restrictions
, or a temporary royalty or rental situation - the amount of the total probable

The ideal form of common-stock analysis leads to a valuation of the issue
 which can be compared with the current price to determine whether or not
 the security is an attractive purchase.
 This valuation would ordinarily be found by estimating the average earnings
 over a period of years in the future and then multiplying that estimate
 by an appropriate "capitalization factor".
 But what are the processes by which the security analyst determines both
 the average future earnings and the suitable capitalization rate? In both

 to purchase the shares at considerably below is indicated appraisal.
 In other words, a low dividend rate creates a bargain issue.
 In the majority of cases the dividend policy is corrected with the passage

Rather than value a business based on its cash flows (intrinsic valuation)

 value it based on assets on its balance sheet.
 This can be useful if you are doing liquidation valuation or so called

 These assets can be tangible or intangible.
 You are valuing each asset and then you are summing up the values of those
 assets.

 Intrinsic value - estimate the expected cash flows on each asset or asset

 past and estimate a value for each asset in the business.

 This cash flow needs to be discounted by the so-called weighted average
 cost of capital (WACC).

 The notion that a dollar today is preferable to a dollar in the future
 is intuitive enough for the most people to grasp without the use of models

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Inflation decreases the purchasing power of cash over time.
 A dollar in the future will buy less than a dollar would buy today.

\begin_layout Enumerate

 There is risk in waiting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The process by which future cash flows are adjusted to reflect these factors
 is called discounting, and the magnitude of these factors is reflected
 in the discount rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The discount rate can be viewed as a composite of the expected real return
 (reflecting consumption preferences), expected inflation (to capture the
 purchasing power of the cash flow), and a premium for uncertainty associated
 with the cash flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The process of discounting converts future cash flows into cash flows in
 today's terms.
 There are 5 types of cash flows - simple cash flows, annuities, growing
 annuities, perpetuities, and growing perpetuities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A simple cash flow is a single cash flow in a specified future time period.
 Discounting a cash flow converts it into today's dollars (or present value)
 and enables the user to compare cash flows at different points in time.
 The present value of a cash flow is calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
cash_flow_in_future_period / (1 + discount_rate) ^ time_period
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
An annuity is a constant cash flow that occurs at regular intervals for
 a fixed period of time.
 While you can compute the present value by discounting each cash flow and
 adding up the numbers, you can also use this equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
annual_cash_flow * ((1 - 1/(1+discount_rate)^number_of_periods) / discount_rate)

 period of time.
 The formula is similar to the one above:

A perpetuity is a constant cash flow at regular intervals forever and the
 present value is obtained by dividing the cash flow by the discount rate.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

A growing perpetuity is a cash flow that is expected to grow at a constant

 The present value of a growing perpetuity can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
expected_cash_flow_next_year / (discount_rate - expected_growth_rate)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Although a growing perpetuity and a growing annuity share several features,
 the fact that a growing perpetuity lasts forever puts constraints on the
 growth rate.
 The growth rate has to be less than the discount rate for the equation
 to work, but an even tighter constraint is that the growth rate used has
 to be lower than the nominal growth rate of the economy, since no asset
 can have cash flows growing faster than that rate forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, assume that you are assessing a stock that paid $2 as dividends
 last year.

\begin_layout Paragraph

Cash Flows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The simplest and most direct measure of the cash flow you get from the company
 for buying its shares is dividends paid.
 One limitation of focusing on dividends is that many companies have shifted
 from dividends to stock buybacks as their mechanism for returning cash
 to stockholders.
 One simple way of adjusting for this is to augment the dividend with stock
 buybacks and look at the cumulative cash returned to stockholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Augmented dividends = dividends + stock buybacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unlike dividends, stock buybacks can spike in some years and may need to
 be averaged across a few years to arrive at more reasonable annualized
 numbers.
 With both dividends and augmented dividends, we are trusting managers at
 publicly traded firms to pay out to stockholders any excess cash left over
 after meeting operating and reinvestment needs.
 However, we do know that managers do not always follow this practice, as
 evidenced by the large cash balances that you see at most publicly traded
 firms.
 To estimate what managers could have returned to equity investors, we develop
 a measure of potential dividends that we term the free cash flow to equity.
 Intuitively, it measures the cash left over after taxes, reinvestment needs,
 and debt cash flows have been met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From net income to potential dividend (or free cash flow to equity): net
 income (earnings to equity investors, after taxes and interest expenses)
 + depreciation (accounting expense - reduced earnings - but not a cash
 expense) - capital expenditures (not an accounting expense, but still a
 cash outflow) - change in non-cash working capital (increases in inventory
 and accounts receivable reduce cash flows, and increases in accounts payable
 increase cash flows.
 If working capital increases, cash flow decreases) - (principal repaid
 - new debt issues) (principal repayments are cash outflows but new debt
 generates cash inflows.
 The net change affects cash flows to equity.) = potential dividend, or FCFE
 (this is the cash left over after all needs are met.
 If it is positive, it represents a potential dividend.
 If it is negative, it is a cash shortfall that has to be covered with new
 equity infusions.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A more conservative version of cash flows to equity, which Warren Buffett
 calls "owners` earnings", ignores the net cash flow from debt.
 Owners' Earnings is a better measure of economic performance than cash
 flow or GAAP earnings, equal to a) operating earnings plus b) depreciation
 and other non-cash charges minus c) required reinvestment in a business
 to maintain present competitive position and unit volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The cash flow to the firm is the cash left over after taxes and after all
 reinvestment needs have been met, but before interest and principal payments
 on debt.
 To get to cash flow to the firm, you start with operating earnings, instead
 of net income, and subtract out taxes paid and reinvestment, defined exactly
 the same way it was to get to free cash flow to equity:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Free cash flow to firm (FCFF) 
\emph default
= after-tax operating income - (net capital expenditures + change in non-cash
 working capital)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or, using our earlier definition of reinvestment, we can also write the
 FCFF as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
reinvestment rate = (net capital expenditure + change in non-cash working
 capital) / after-tax operating income
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
so FCFF = after-tax operating income * (1 - reinvestment rate)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The reinvestment rate can exceed 100% if the firm is reinvesting more than
 it is earning, or it can be less than 0, for firms that are divesting assets
 and shrinking capital.
 Above 100% - in practical terms, this firm will have to raise either new
 debt or new equity to cover the excess reinvestment.
 Both FCFE and FCFF are after taxes and reinvestment and both can be negative,
 either because a firm has negative earnings or because it has reinvestment
 needs that exceed income.
 The key difference is that the FCFE is after debt cash flows and the FCFF
 is before.

Risk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cash flows that are riskier should be assessed a lower value than more stable
 cash flows.
 In conventional discounted cash flow valuation models, we use higher discount
 rates on riskier cash flows and lower discount rates on safer cash flows.
 The definition of risk will depend upon whether you are valuing the business
 or just the equity.
 When valuing the business, you look at the risk in a firm's operations.
 When valuing equity, you look at the risk in the equity investment in this
 business, which is partly determined by the risk of the business the firm
 is in and partly by its choice on how much debt to use to fund that business.
 The equity in a safe business can become risky, if the firm uses enough
 debt to fund that business.
 In discount rate terms, the risk in the equity in a business is measured
 with the cost of equity, whereas the risk in the business is captured in
 the cost of capital.
 The latter will be weighted average of the cost of equity and the cost
 of debt, with the weights reflecting the proportional use of each source
 of funding.

 sector betas if the firm operates in many businesses.
 The sector beta is more precise than an individual regression beta because
 averaging across many betas results in averaging out your mistakes.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Some people use government bond rate - US Treasury Bond rate for instance.
 It's not that simple though.
 To really get something that's risk-free, you first have to make sure that
 the entity issuing the security has no default risk.
 It is not easy to do in some parts of the world.
 It can be different in different currencies.
 But for USD, you can use 10- or 30-year government bonds rates as risk-free
 rate, implicitly assuming that governments don't default.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For an investment to be risk-free, it has to have no default risk and no
 reinvestment risk.
 Also, time horizon matters - if your cash flows stretch out over the long
 term, your risk free rate has to be a long term risk free rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you do valuation, it can be in nominal terms (reflect expected inflation),
 or real terms (ignoring inflation) - nominal/real cash flows.
 If your cash flows are nominal cash flows, what currency you're going to
 do the cash flows - the currency becomes an issue only with nominal cash
 flows.
 You can value any company in any currency.
 Once you pick the currency in which you're going to estimate the cash flows,
 your discount rate has to be exactly in that currency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The cost of equity - should be higher for riskier investments and lower
 for safer investments.
 There are many models to calculate this: CAPM (you need risk free rate,
 beta relative to market portfolio, and market risk premium), APM (as CAPM,
 but it's a little more creative in measuring market risk - rather than
 capture all with 1 beta, this allows to input multiple sources of market
 risk and allow for beta for each one), Multifactor (this includes also
 macro factors - interest rates, inflation, etc), Proxy (it takes the last
 20 years, especially if we have access to more data; you don't measure
 risk in traditional way; instead, it's measured for example - smaller companies
 are riskier than large cap companies, or we can use also other proxies;
 the proxy models can be an add on to traditional models.
 You often see composite models - where you measure beta as a risk and a
 proxy thrown to the model).
 For all of those models, you need a risk-free rate.

 how much risk they perceive in stocks and how concerned they are about
 that risk.
 To estimate this number, analysts often look at the past; between 1928
 and 2010, for instance, stocks generated 4.31 % more, on an annual basis,
 than treasury bonds.
 An alternative is to back out a forward-looking premium (called an implied
 equity risk premium) from current stock price levels and expected future
 cash flows.
 In January 2011, the implied equity risk premium in the US was approximately
 5%.

\begin_layout Itemize
It is a number that can and should change over time.
 Important questions - how far you go in history? Geometric or arithmetic
 average? It used to be between ~2-8%, depending on how and when you calculate
 it.
 But even with long time periods of history, the risk premium that you derive
 will have substantial standard error.
 
\end_layout

This is used almost in every valuation.
 Put simply, if you want a higher risk premium from a risky asset (or class),

\begin_layout Itemize
Default spread - to estimate this, you can use a bond rating for a company,
 if one exists, from a rating agency such as S&P or Moody's.
 If there is no published bond rating, you can estimate a "synthetic" rating
 for the firm, based on the ratio of operating income to interest expenses
 (interest coverage ratio); higher interest coverage ratios will yield higher
 ratings.
 Once you have a bond rating, you can estimate a default spread by looking
 at publicly traded bonds with that rating.

It's the rate at which you can borrow long term today - it will reflect

 Here is what should go there - risk-free rate plus a default spread (that's
 how much a bank or a bond holder will charge you over and above the risk-free
 rate because they're worried they will not get paid because of credit risk).
 Estimating cost of debt, 2 used methods:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
looking at the yield of maturity on a straight bond outstanding from the
 firm, (but that gives me an interest rates on a specific bond, not the
 interest rates for all of the debt of the company)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
looking at the rating for the firm and estimating a default spread based
 upon a rating (S&P or Moody)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a company doesn't have rating, which are 90-95% of all publicly traded
 companies, you can estimate rating (synthetic rating).
 It can be done by looking at financial ratios - that's what financial agencies
 are using anyway to come up with the rating.
 In the simplest form, the rating can be estimated from the interest coverage
 ratio (which is EBIT / Interest Expenses).
 Then this interest coverage ratio has to be converted into a rating.
 You can lookup at rated companies and their interest coverage ratios and
 then you can try to do some reverse engineering - so you will estimate
 what the rating would be given the interest coverage ratio.
 You can have 2 sets of tables - one for large (above $5 billion market
 cap) and the other one for small cap companies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, once you have the risk free rate and default spread, you can just
 sum up these 2 numbers and you have pre-tax cost of debt.
 BTW, the default spread can be estimated from the rating, or a traded bond
 issued by the company, or even a company CDS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you have to think of 2 types of default risks - one is a default risk
 of a company and the other is of a country.
 If a company is in Brazil for example, and Brazil country default spread
 is 6%, then the formula can be: risk-free rate + 2/3(Brazil country default
 spread) + company default spread.

\begin_layout Itemize
Now when you have cost of equity and cost of debt, you need to estimate
 the weights for each, based on market values (rather than book value).
 For publicly traded firms, multiplying the share price by the number of
 shares outstanding will yield market value of equity.
 Estimating the market value of debt is usually a more difficult exercise,
 since most firms have some debt that is not traded and many practitioners
 fall back on using book value of debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We'll bring them together to get cost of capital.
 For that, we have to have weights of equity and weights of debt.

 the price is wrong.

Growth Rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When confronted with the task of estimating growth, it is not surprising
 that analysts turn to the past, using growth in revenues or earnings in
 the recent past as a predictor of growth in the future.
 However, the historical growth rates for the same company can vary, depending
 upon computational choices: how far back to go, which measure of earnings
 (net income, earnings per share, operating income) to use, and how to compute
 the average (arithmetic or geometric).
 Studies indicate that the relationship between past and future growth for
 most companies is a very weak one, with growth dropping off significantly
 as companies grow and revealing significant volatility from period to period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a firm to grow, it has to either manage its existing investments better
 (efficiency growth) or make new investments (new investment growth).
 To capture efficiency growth, you want to measure the potential for cost
 cutting and improved profitability.
 It can generate substantial growth in the near term, especially for poorly
 run mature firms, but not forever.
 To measure the growth rate from new investments, you should look at how
 much of its earnings a firm is reinvesting back in the business and the
 return on these investments.
 The way we'll look at these two terms will depend upon whether we are looking
 at equity earnings or operating income.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
With equity earnings, we measure reinvestment as the portion of net income
 not paid out as dividends (retention ratio) and use the return on equity
 to measure the quality of investment.

 and use the return on capital to measure investment quality.

 average, operating income, revenues, ...
 etc check estimation period - starting point for the computation can make
 a big difference recognize that growth rates become meaningless when earnings
 go from negative to positive values recognize that growth rates will go
 down as companies get larger.
 Worst of all, there is an evidence that historical growth rates in earnings
 are not very good predictors of future earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Terminal Value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Publicly traded firms can, at least in theory, last forever.
 Since we cannot estimate cash flows forever, we generally impose closure
 in valuation models by stopping our estimation of cash flows sometime in
 the future and then computing a terminal value that reflects estimated
 value at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firm is in a stable growth at the terminal value - growth at constant rate
 forever.
 Since we cannot estimate cash flows forever, we estimate cash flows for
 a "growth period" and then estimate a terminal value, to capture the value
 at the end period.
 There are 3 ways of calculating it:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Liquidation value - most useful when assets are separable and marketable.
 This is mostly for private businesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple approach - easiest approach but makes the valuation a relative
 valuation, not intrinsic valuation!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stable growth model - technically the soundest, but requires that you make
 judgments about when the firm will grow at a stable rate which it can sustain
 forever, and the excess returns (if any) that it will earn during the period.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What gets usually a valuation into a trouble is terminal value.
 Check:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the stable growth rate cannot exceed the growth rate of the economy.
 One simple proxy for the nominal growth rate of the economy is the risk
 free rate = expected inflation + expected real interest rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nominal growth rate in economy = expected inflation + expected real growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
when will the firm reach stable growth? About 99% of growth companies have
 growth periods less than 10 years.
 Medium growth period for high growth company is 3-5 years.
 The stronger and more sustainable the competitive advantage a company has,
 the longer its growth period can be.
 So do some strategic analysis of a company.
 With return of capital and stable growth, set it to cost of capital.
 If you think that your company really has a powerful comparative advantage,
 you can set return of capital higher than cost of capital, by 2-3%.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The two legitimate ways of estimating terminal value are to:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
estimate a liquidation value for the assets of the firm, assuming that the
 assets are sold in the terminal year, or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
estimate a going concern value, assuming that the firm's operations continue.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If we assume that the business will be ended in the terminal year and that
 its assets will be liquidated at that time, we can estimate the proceeds
 from the liquidation, using a combination of market-based numbers (for
 assets such as real estate that have ready markets) and estimates.
 For firms that have finite lives and marketable assets, this represents
 a fairly conservative way of estimating terminal value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If we treat the firm as a going concern at the end of the estimation period,
 we can estimate the value of that concern by assuming that cash flows will
 grow at a constant rate forever afterwards.
 This perpetual growth model draws in a simple present value equation to
 arrive at terminal value:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
terminal value in year n = cash flow in year (n+1) / (discount rate - perpetual
 growth rate)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The definitions of cash flow and growth rate have to be consistent with
 whether we are valuing dividends, cash flows to equity, or cash flows to
 the firm; the discount rate will be the cost of equity for the first 2
 and the cost of capital for the last.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since the terminal value equation is sensitive to small changes and thus
 ripe for abuse, there are three key constraints that should be imposed
 on its estimation:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
No firm can grow forever at a rate higher than the growth rate of the economy
 in which it operates.
 In fact, a simple rule of thumb on the stable growth rate is that it should
 not exceed the risk-free rate used in the valuation; the risk-free rate
 is composed of expected inflation and a real interest rate, which should
 equate to the nominal growth rate of the economy in the long term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As firms move from high growth to stable growth, we need to give them the
 characteristics of stable growth firms; as a general rule, their risk levels
 should move towards the market (beta of one) and debt ratios should increase
 to industry norms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A stable growth firm should reinvest enough to sustain the assumed growth
 rate.
 Given the relationship between growth, reinvestment rate, and returns that
 we established in the section on expected growth rates, we can estimate
 this reinvestment rate:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
reinvestment rate = expected growth rate in operating (net income) / return
 on capital (equity)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Thus, the effect on the terminal value of increasing the growth rate will
 be partially or completely offset by the loss in cash flows because of
 the higher reinvestment rate.
 Whether value increases or decreases as the stable growth rate increases
 will entirely depend upon what you assume about the return on investment.
 If the return on capital (equity) is higher than the cost of capital (equity)
 in the stable growth period, increasing the stable growth rate will increase
 value.
 If the return on capital is equal to the stable period cost of capital,
 increasing the stable growth rate will have no effect on value.
 The key assumption in the terminal value computation is not what growth
 rate you use in the valuation, but what excess returns a company that growth
 rate.
 There are some analysts who believe that zero excess return is the only
 sustainable assumption for stable growth, since no firm can maintain competitiv
e advantages forever.
 In practice, though, firms with strong and sustainable competitive advantages
 can maintain excess returns, though at fairly modest levels, for very long
 time periods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you discounted dividends or free cash flows to equity on a per-share
 basis at the cost of equity, you have your estimate of value per share.
 If you discounted cash flows to the firm, you have 4 adjustments to make
 to get to value per share:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Add back the cash balance of the firm.
 Since free cash flow to the firm is based upon operating income, you have
 not considered the income from cash or incorporated it into value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adjust for cross holdings.
 Add back the values of small (minority) holdings that you have in other
 companies; the income from these holdings was not included in your cash
 flow.
 If you have a majority stake in another company, the requirement that you
 consolidate and report 100% of the subsidiary's operating income as your
 own will create minority interests, the accounting estimate of the portion
 of the subsidiary that does not belong to you.
 You have to subtract out the estimated market value of the minority interest
 from your consolidated firm value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Subtract other potential liabilities.
 If you have underfunded pension or health care obligations or ongoing lawsuits
 that may generate large liabilities, you have to estimate a value and subtract
 it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Subtract the value of management options.
 When companies give options to employees, analysts often use short cuts
 (such as adjusting the number of shares for dilution) to deal with these
 options.
 The right approach is to value the options (using option pricing models),
 reduce the value of equity by the option value, and then divide by the
 actual number of shares outstanding.
\end_layout

 become more undervalued over time.
 That is why a long time horizon is almost a prerequisite for using intrinsic

 Relative valuation outnumbers DCF valuation (even when someone is doing

 considered as a relative valuation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Relative valuations are far easier to sell than intrinsic valuations, because
 as long as you let me pick the multiple and comparables, I can tell you
 whatever story I want to tell you.
 And also it's far easy to defend a relative valuation than an intrinsic
 valuation - in intrinsic valuation your assumptions are all explicit -
 everybody can see what you're assuming about cash flows, growth, and risk,
 and that's dangerous because they can pick it apart.
 In relative valuation, all you assumptions are implicit - when you are
 using 12 times EBIDTA, you are making assumptions, but nobody can see what
 those assumptions are.
 If they cannot see them, they cannot pick them apart.
 Aswath Damodaran thinks that in the long term you are far more likely to
 be right with intrinsic valuation than relative valuation, but here's the
 catch - when you're wrong with intrinsic valuation, you are also far more
 likely to be wrong alone = fired.
 Survival instinct.
 That's why more people are using relative valuation.

Peter Lynch on P/E Ratio
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It can be thought of as the number of years it will take the company to
 earn back the amount of your initial investment - assuming, of course,
 that the company's earnings stay constant.
 Why would anyone would want to buy a stock with higher P/E? Corporate earnings
 do not stay constant any more than human earnings do.
 In some stocks, investors are just willing to take substantial gambles
 on the improved future earnings of some companies (with higher P/E), while
 they're quite skeptical about the future of others (with lower P/E).
 It can be seen also that P/E levels tend to be lowest for the slow growers
 and highest for the fast growers, with the cyclicals in between.
 That's as it should be.
 Some people believe in buying any and all stocks with low P/E, but according
 to Lynch, that doesn't make any sense.
 We shouldn't compare apples to oranges.
 But you don't want to ignore P/E altogether.
 You might begin by asking whether the P/E ratios of various stocks are
 low, high, or average, relative to the industry norms.
 Before you buy a stock, you might want to track its P/E ratio back through
 several years to get a sense of its normal levels.
 It's good to avoid stocks with excessively high P/E ratios.
 You'll save a lot of grief and lot of money if you do.
 With few exceptions, an extremely high P/E ratio is a handicap to a stock.
 A company with a high P/E must have incredible earnings growth to justify
 the high price that's been put on the stock.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Company P/E ratios do not exist in a vacuum.
 The stock market as a whole has its own collective P/E ratio, which is
 a good indicator of whether the market at large is overvalued or undervalued.
 It can be good to see whether the whole market is inflated, and if so,
 it's likely that most stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to
 earnings.

\begin_layout Itemize
There are five basic ways a company can increase earnings: reduce costs,
 raise prices, expand into new markets, sell more of its product in the
 old markets, revitalize close or otherwise dispose of a losing operation.

Aswath Damodaran on Relative Valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assets are valued by looking at how the market prices similar assets.
 Thus, when determining what to pay for a house, you would look at what
 similar houses in the neighborhood sold for.
 With a stock, that means comparing its pricing to similar stocks, usually
 in its "peer group".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It's all about comparing how the market prices different companies, with
 the intent of finding bargains.
 In relative valuation, you value an asset based on how similar assets are
 priced in the market.
 There are 3 essential steps:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Find comparable assets that are priced by the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Scale the market prices to a common variable to generate standardized prices
 that are comparable across assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adjust for differences across assets when comparing their standardized values.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Relative valuation can be done with less information and more quickly than

In other words, it is cheap with no good reason for being cheap.
 In the real world, most assets that look cheap on a multiple of earnings
 basis deserve to be cheap.
 In other words, one or more of these variables works against the company
 (it has low growth, high risk, or low ROE).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are 4 steps to understanding multiple:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Define the multiple.
 The same multiple can be defined in different ways by different users.
 When comparing and using multiples estimated by someone else, it is critical
 that we understand how the multiples have been estimated.
 Multiple must be consistent - nominator and denominator must use the same
 principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe the multiple.
 Too many people who use a multiple have no idea what its cross sectional
 distribution is.
 If you do not know what the cross sectional distribution of a multiple
 is, it is difficult to look at number and pass judgment on whether it is
 too high or low.
 How has this multiple changed over time? What is the average and std deviation
 of this multiple across the universe? How large are outliers, how to deal
 with them? When a distribution is full of outliers, it's better to trust
 the medium, not the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Analyze the multiple.
 It is critical to understand the fundamentals that drive each multiple,
 and the nature of the relationship between the multiple and each variable.
 Analyze the distribution.
 How do changes in the fundamentals change the multiple? The relationship
 between a fundamental (e.g.
 growth) and a multiple (e.g.
 PE) is almost never linear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply the multiple.
 Defining the comparable universe and controlling for differences is far
 more difficult in practice than it is in theory.
 It is impossible to find an exactly identical firm to the one you are valuing.
 There is no reason why a firm cannot be compared with another firm in a
 very different business, if the two firms have the same risk, growth, and
 cash flow characteristics.
 While traditional analysis is built on the premise that firms in the same
 sector are comparable firms, valuation theory would suggest that a comparable
 firm is one which is similar to the one being analyzed in terms of fundamentals.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When estimating market value, you have 3 choices:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Market value of equity.
 The price per share or market capitalization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Market value of firm.
 The sum of the market values of both debt and equity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Market value of operating assets or enterprise value.
 The sums of the market values of debt and equity, but with cash netted
 out of the value.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When measuring earnings and book value, you can again measure them from
 the perspective only of equity investors or of both debt and equity (firm).
 Thus, earnings per share and net income are earnings to equity, whereas
 operating income measures earnings to the firm.
 The shareholders` equity on a balance sheet is book value of equity; the
 book value of the entire business includes debt; and the book value of
 invested capital is that book value, net of cash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiples are easy to use and easy to misuse.
 There are 4 basic steps to using multiples wisely and detecting misuse
 in the hands of others, starting with making sure that they are defined
 consistently, and then moving on to looking at their distributional characteris
tics and the variables that determine their values, and concluding with
 using them in comparisons across firms.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
PE - it can be computed using earnings from the last fiscal year (current
 PE), last four quarters (trailing PE), or the next four quarters (forward
 PE), yielding very different estimates.
 It can also vary depending upon whether you use diluted or primary earnings.
 The first test to run on a multiple is to examine whether the numerator
 and denominator are defined consistently.
 If the numerator is an equity value, then the denominator should be an
 equity value as well.
 If the numerator is a firm value, then the denominator should be a firm
 value as well.
 Price per share (which is an equity value) in the nominator and earnings
 per share (also an equity value) in denominator is consistent.
 So is the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, since the numerator and
 denominator are both measures of operating assets; the EV measures the
 market value of the operating assets of a company and the EBITDA is the
 cash flow generated by the operating assets.
 In contrast, the price to sales ratio and price to EBITDA are not consistently
 defined, since they divide the market value of equity by an operating measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For comparisons across companies, the multiple has to be defined uniformly
 across all of the firms in the group.
 Thus, if the trailing PE is used for one firm, it has to be used for all
 of the others as well, and the trailing earnings per share has to be computed
 the same way for all firms in the sample.
 Note that even with the same accounting standards governing companies,
 there can be differences across firms that arise because of discretionary
 accounting choices.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If your sample/distribution is skewed towards one extreme, the average as
 a comparison measure can be dangerous.
 It makes far more sense to focus on the median.
 To prevent outliers from skewing numbers, data reporting services that
 compute and report average values for multiples either throw out outliers
 when computing the averages or constrain the multiples to be less than
 or equal to a fixed number.
 The consequence is that averages reported by two services for the same
 sector or the market will almost never match up because they deal with
 outliers differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With every multiple, there are firms for which the multiple cannot be computed.
 For example PE ratio - when the earnings per share are negative, the P/E
 for a firm is not meaningful and is usually not reported.
 These are firms that are losing money.
 If you are doing a sector analysis, and you drop a lot of companies because
 they have negative PE ratios, then the average PE ratio for the group will
 be biased because of the elimination of these firms.
 As a general rule, you should be skeptical about any multiple that results
 in a significant reduction in the number of firms being analyzed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PE ratios across time - comparisons of multiples across time are fraught
 with danger.
 For instance, the common practice of branding a market to be under or overvalue
d based upon comparing the PE ratio today to past PE ratios will lead to
 misleading judgments when interest rates are higher or lower than historical
 norms.
 Also, relative valuations have short shelf lives.
 A stock may look cheap relative to comparable companies today, but that
 assessment can shift dramatically over the next few months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You make just as many assumptions when you do a relative valuation as you
 do in a discounted cash flow valuation.
 The difference is that the assumptions in a relative valuation are implicit
 and unstated, whereas those in discounted cash flow valuation are explicit
 and stated.
 In the intrinsic valuation, we observed that the value of a firm is a function
 of 3 variables - its capacity to generate cash flows, its expected growth
 in these cash flows, and the uncertainty associated with these cash flows.
 Every multiple, whether it is of earnings, revenues, or book value, is
 a function of the same 3 variables - risk, growth, and cash flow generating
 potential.
 Intuitively, firms with higher growth rates, less risk, and greater cash
 flow generating potential should trade at higher multiples than firms with
 lower growth, higher risk, and less cash flow potential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If there are enough firms in the industry to allow for it, this list can
 be pruned further using other criteria; for instance, only firms of similar
 size may be considered.
 No matter how carefully we construct our list of comparable firms, we will
 end up with firms that are different from the firm we are valuing.
 There are three ways of controlling for these differences:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Comparison of the multiple a firm trades at to the average computed for
 the sector; if it is significantly different, the analyst can make a judgment
 about whether the firm's individual characteristics (growth, risk or cash
 flows) may explain the difference.
 If, in the judgment of the analyst, the difference in a multiple cannot
 be explained by fundamentals (growth / risk), the firm will be viewed as
 under/over valued.
 The weakness in this approach is not that analysts are called upon to make
 subjective judgments, but that the judgments are often based upon little
 more than guesswork.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We modify the multiple to take into account the most important variable
 determining it - the companion variable.
 For example, analysts who compare PE ratios across companies with very
 different growth rates often divide the PE ratio by the expected growth
 rate in EPS to determine a growth-adjusted PE ratio, or the PEG ratio.
 There are 2 implicit assumptions that we make when using these modified
 multiples.
 The first is that these firms are all of equivalent risk.
 The second is that growth and PE move proportionately; when growth doubles,
 PE ratios double as well.
 If this assumption does not hold up and PE ratio do not increase proportionally
 to growth, companies with high growth rates will look cheap on a PEG ratio
 basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When there is more than 1 variable to adjust for, when comparing across
 companies, there are statistical techniques that offer promise.
 In a multiple regression, for instance, we attempt to explain a dependent
 variable (such as PE or EV/EBITDA) by using independent variables (such
 as growth and risk) that we believe influence the dependent variable.
 Regression offers two advantages over the subjective approach.
 First, the output from the regression gives us a measure of how strong
 the relationship is between the multiple and the variable(s) being used.
 Second, unlike the modified multiple approach, where we were able to control
 for differences on only one variable, a regression can be extended to allow
 for more than 1 variable and even for cross effects across these variables.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The two approaches to valuation - intrinsic and relative valuation - will
 generally yield different estimates of value for the same firm at the same
 point in time.
 It is even possible for one approach to generate the results that the stock
 is undervalued while the other concludes that it is overvalued.
 The differences in value between discounted cash flow valuation and relative
 valuation come from different views of market efficiency or inefficiency.
 In discounted cash flow valuation, we assume that markets make mistakes,
 that they correct these mistakes over time, and that these mistakes can
 often occur across entire sectors or even the entire market.
 In relative valuation, we assume that while markets make mistakes on individual
 stocks, they are correct on average.
 In other words, when we value a new software company relative to other
 small software companies, we are assuming that the market has priced these
 companies correctly on average, even though it might have made mistakes
 in the pricing of each of them individually.
 Thus, a stock may be overvalued on a discounted cash flow basis but undervalued
 on a relative basis, if the firms used for comparison in the relative valuation
 are all overpriced by the market.
 The reverse would occur if an entire sector or market were underpriced.

Option Pricing Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not for valuing options, but businesses.
 Real option advocates a belief that you should be paying a premium on DCF
 value estimates.
 This is not an alternative to DCF, it is its augmentation.
 For every hundred options, maybe two or three will pass the following tests
 you gotta meet to applying these models to valuing an asset:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You gotta make sure that there is an option embedded in an action.
 Can you identify the underlying asset? Can you specify the contingency
 under which you will get payoff?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is there exclusivity? If yes, there is option value.
 If no, there is none.
 If in between, you have to scale value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Can you use an option pricing model to value the real option? Can you trade
 the underlying asset and option?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Applying option pricing models in the context of valuation - this is being
 used only if something happens.
 For example, there is an undeveloped oil reserve company, and those oil
 reserves will have value only if oil prices go up beyond a certain level.
 Or a gold mining company with gold reserves.
 Or a biotechnological company with the patent that's not viable right now
 but potentially viable in the future.
 Or a stock of a deeply troubled company - a money-losing company with a
 lot of debt - you are effectively buying an option.
 These are examples of where you can apply this model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You are using those option pricing models to value businesses or assets
 that have option like characteristics.
 Options derive the value from an underlying asset.
 They have contingent payoff and limited life.

Warren Buffett uses the Black-Scholes formula when valuing his equity put
 options for financial statement purposes.
 Key inputs to the calculation include a contract's maturity and strike
 price, as well as the analyst's expectations for volatility, interest rates
 and dividends.
 However, if the formula is applied to extended time periods (for long-dated
 options), it can produce absurd results.

More general and less restrictive model, but it requires more data on how

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most practitioners use Binomial Model and they argue that early exercise
 is the rule rather than the exception with real options, and that underlying
 asset values are generally discontinuous.
 But Binomial model is not an easy choice.
 All of the information needed for this model will often lead you to a dead
 end.
 There might be an easier way using a decision trees and basic statistics
 that you can value any asset.

 There are a number of ways in which this may occur.
 The most important of these are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Failure to pay dividends commensurate both with earnings and with the value
 of the stockholders' equity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use of stockholders' money in a relatively unprofitable manner.

\begin_layout Itemize
Use of stockholders' money to buy back their stock at an inadequate price.

\begin_layout Itemize
Maintenance of a holding-company set-up, in face of the fact that outside
 stockholders (those with not direct participation in control of corporate

 assets directly.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(Warren Buffett on intrinsic value) Unlike many CEOs, who desire their company's
 stock to trade at the highest possible prices in the market, Buffett prefer
 Berkshire stock to trade at or around its intrinsic value - neither materially
 higher nor lower.
 Such linkage means that business results during one period will benefit
 the people who owned the company during that period.
 Maintaining the linkage requires a shareholder group with a collective
 long-term, business-oriented investment philosophy, rather than a short-term,
 market-oriented strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(Warren Buffett on dividends) Managers and owners should think hard about
 the circumstances under which earnings should be retained and under which
 they should be distributed.
 Allocation of capital is crucial to business and investment management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In judging whether managers should retain earnings, shareholders should
 not simply compare total incremental earnings in recent years to total
 incremental capital because that relationship may be distorted by what
 is going on in a core business.
 During an inflationary period, companies with a core business characterized
 by extraordinary economics can use small amounts of incremental capital
 in that business at very high rates of return.
 But, unless they are experiencing tremendous unit growth, outstanding businesse
s by definition generate large amounts of excess cash.
 If a company sinks most of this money in other businesses that earn low
 returns, the company's overall return on retained capital may nevertheless
 appear excellent because of the extraordinary returns being earned by the
 portion of earnings incrementally invested in the core business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many corporations that consistently show good returns both on equity and
 on overall incremental capital have, indeed, employed a large portion of
 their retained earnings on an economically unattractive, even disastrous
 basis.
 Their marvelous core businesses, however, whose earnings grow year after
 year, camouflage repeated failures in capital allocation elsewhere (usually
 involving high-priced acquisition of businesses that have inherently mediocre
 economics).
 The managers at fault periodically report on the lesson they have learned
 from the latest disappointment.
 They then usually seek out future lessons.
 (Failure seems to go to their heads.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In such cases, shareholders would be far better off if earnings were retained
 only to expand the high-return business, with the balance paid in dividends
 or used to repurchase stock (an action that increases the owners' interest
 in the exceptional business while sparing them participation in subpar
 businesses).
 Managers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much of the
 cash thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with low returns
 should be held to account for those allocation decisions, regardless of
 how profitable the overall enterprise is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Payments should reflect long-term expectations for both earnings and returns
 on incremental capital.
 Since the long-term corporate outlook changes only infrequently, dividend
 patterns should change no more often.
 But over time distributable earnings that have been withheld by managers
 should earn their keep.
 If earnings have been unwisely retained, it is likely that managers, too,
 have been unwisely retained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Corporate dividend policy is a major capital allocation issue, always of
 interest to investors but infrequently explained to them.
 Buffett's essays clarify this subject, emphasizing that "capital allocation
 is crucial to business and investment management." Since 1988, Berkshire's
 common stock has been priced in the market at above $50k per share and
 the company's book value, earnings, and intrinsic value have steadily increased
 well in excess of average annual rates.
 Yet the company has never effected a stock split, and has not paid a cash
 dividend in over three decades.
 Berkshire's dividend policy also reflects Buffett's conviction that a company's
 earnings payout versus retention decision should be based on a single test:
 each dollar of earnings should be retained if retention will increase market
 value by at least a like amount; otherwise it should be paid out.
 Earnings retention is justified only when "capital retained produces incrementa
l earnings equal to, or above, those generally available to investors." Like
 many of Buffett's simple rules, this one is often ignored by corporate
 managers, except of course when they make dividend decisions for their
 subsidiaries.
 Earnings are often retained for non-owner reasons, such as expanding the
 corporate empire or furnishing operational comfort for management.

Directors are rarely independent of management.
 They should be, of course, but it does not work out that way.
 Officers choose the directors more often that the directors choose the
 officers.
 In many cases the executives actually constitute a majority of the board.
 Where this occurs the notion of that the directors serve as a check on
 the management is patently incorrect.

Many annual meetings are a waste of time, both for shareholders and for
 management.
 Sometimes that is true because management is reluctant to open up on matters
 of business substance.
 More often a non-productive session is the fault of shareholder participants
 who are more concerned about their own moment on stage than they are about
 the affairs of the corporation.
 What should be a forum for business discussion becomes a forum for theatrics
 and advocacy of issues (the deal is irresistible: for the price of one
 share you get to tell a captive audience your ideas as to how the world
 should be run.) Under such circumstances, the quality of the meeting often
 deteriorates from year to year as the antics of those interested in themselves
 discourage attendance by those interested in the business.

When Charlie and Buffett read reports, they have no interest in pictures
 of personnel, plants or products.
 References to EBITDA make them shudder.
 They are very suspicious of accounting methodology that is vague or unclear,
 since too often that means management wishes to hide something.
 Berkshire puts its annual and quarterly financials on the Internet between
 the close of the market on Friday and the following morning.
 By doing so, shareholders and other interested investors have timely access
 to these important releases and also have a reasonable amount of time to
 digest the information they include before the markets open on Monday.

\begin_layout Itemize
Buffett and Munger tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors
 with fancy predictions.
 A few of those managers will prove prophetic-but others will turn out to
 be congenital optimists, or even charlatans.
 Unfortunately, it's not easy for investors to know in advance which species
 they are dealing with.
 It's both deceptive and dangerous for CEOs to predict growth rates for
 their companies.
 Too often these predictions lead to trouble.
 It's fine for a CEO to have his own internal goals and in our view, it's
 even appropriate for the CEO to publicly express some hopes about the future,
 if these expectations are accompanied by sensible caveats.
 But for a major corporations to predict that its per-share earnings will
 grow over the long term at, say 15% annually is to court trouble.
 That's because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by
 a very small percentage of large businesses.
 The problem isn't just lofty unwarranted optimism.
 They corrode CEO behavior.
 They can engage uneconomic operating maneuvers so that they could meet
 earnings targets they had announced.
 Worse still, after exhausting all that operating acrobatics would do, they
 sometimes played a wide variety of accounting games to "make the numbers."
 These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing: once a company
 moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur
 thereafter require it to engage in further accounting maneuvers that must
 be even more "heroic." These can turn fudging into fraud.
\end_layout

Three suggestions for investors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Beware of companies displaying weak accounting.
 If a company still does not expense options, or if its pension assumptions
 are fanciful, watch out.
 When management take the low road in aspects that are visible, it is likely
 they are following a similar path behind the scenes.
 There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Trumpeting EBITDA is a particularly pernicious practice.
 Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that
 it is a "non-cash" charge.
 That's nonsense.
 In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the
 cash outlay it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has
 delivered any benefits to the business.
 Imagine, if you will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid
 all of its employees for the next ten years of their service (in the way
 they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years).
 In the following 9 years, compensation would be a "non-cash" expense -
 a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset established this year.
 Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two
 through ten would be simply a bookkeeping formality?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management.
 If you can't understand a footnote or other managerial explanation, it's
 usually because the CEO doesn't want you to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth
 expectations.
 Business seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings
 simply don't advance smoothly (except, of course, in the offering books
 of investment bankers).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Buffett and Munger don't know today what Berkshire will earn next year -
 not even what they will earn next quarter.

Managers that always promise to "make the numbers" will at some point be

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The supreme irony of business management is that it is far easier for an
 inadequate CEO to keep his job than it is for an inadequate subordinate.
 However, a CEO who doesn't perform is frequently carried in definitely.
 One reason is that performance standards for his job seldom exist.
 When they do, they are often fuzzy or they may be waived or explained away,
 even when the performance shortfalls are major and repeated.
 At too many companies, the boss shoots the arrow of managerial performance
 and then hastily paints the bulls-eye around the spot where it lands.
 Also, CEO has no immediate superior whose performance is itself getting
 measured.
 CEO's boss is a board of directors that seldom measures itself and is infrequen
tly held to account for substandard corporate performance.
 If the board makes a mistake in hiring, and perpetuates that mistake, so
 what? Even if the company is taken over because of the mistake, the deal
 will probably bestow substantial benefits on the outgoing board members.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, relations between the board and the CEO are expected to be congenial.
 At board meetings, criticism of the CEO's performance is often viewed as
 the social equivalent of belching.
 No such inhibitions restrain the office manager from critically evaluating
 the substandard typist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are three fundamentally different manager/owner situation that exist
 in publicly held companies:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
No controlling shareholder (this is the most common).
 In this case, Buffett believes directors should behave as if there is a
 single absentee owner, whose long-term interest they should try to further
 in all proper ways.
 Unfortunately, "long-term" gives directors a lot of wiggle room.
 If they lack either integrity or the ability to think independently, directors
 can do great violence to shareholders while still claiming to be acting
 in their long-term interest.
 But assume the board is functioning well and must deal with a management
 that is mediocre or worse.
 Directors then have the responsibility for changing that management, just
 as an intelligent owner would do if he were present.
 And if able but greedy managers overreach and try to dip too deeply into
 shareholders' pockets, directors must slap their hands.
 The (ideally, mostly outside) board members should establish standards
 for the CEO's performance and should also periodically meet without his
 being present, to evaluate his performance against those standards.
 This requires for board membership should be business savvy, interest in
 the job and owner-orientation.
 Too often, directors are selected simply because they are prominent or
 add diversity to the board.
 This practice is a mistake.
 Mistakes in selecting directors are particularly serious because appointments
 are so hard to undo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Controlling owner is also the manager (as is Berkshire).
 At some companies, this arrangement is facilitated by the existence of
 two classes of stock endowed with disproportionate voting power.
 In these situations, it's obvious that the board does not act as an agent
 between owners and management and that the directors cannot effect change
 except through persuasion.
 Therefore, if the owner/manager is mediocre or worse-or is ever-reaching-there
 is little a director can do about it except object.
 If change does not come and the matter is sufficiently serious, the outside
 directors should resign.
 Their resignation will signal their doubts about management, and it will
 emphasize that no outsider is in a position to correct the owner/manager's
 shortcomings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
No controlling owner who is not involved in management.
 This case puts the outside directors in a potentially useful position.
 If they become unhappy with either the competence or integrity of the manager,
 they can go directly to the owner (who may also be on the board) and report
 their dissatisfaction.
 This situation is ideal for an outside director, since he needs to make
 his case only to a single, presumably interested owner, who can forthwith
 effect change if the argument is persuasive.
 Even so, the dissatisfied director has only that single course of action.
 If he remains unsatisfied about a critical matter, he has no choice but
 to resign.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Logically, this case should be the most effective in insuring first-class
 management.
 In the second case the owner is not going to fire himself, and in the first
 case, directors often find it very difficult to deal with mediocrity or
 mild over-reaching.
 Unless the unhappy directors can win over a majority of the board - an
 awkward social and logistical task, particularly if management's behavior
 is merely odious, not egregious-their hands are effectively tied.
 In practice, directors trapped in situations of this kind usually convince
 themselves that by staying around they can do at least some good.
 Meanwhile, management proceeds unfettered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the third case, the owner is neither judging himself nor burdened with
 the problem or garnering a majority.
 He can also insure that outside directors are selected who will bring useful
 qualities to the board.
 These directors, in turn, will know that the good advice they give will
 reach the right ears, rather than being stifled by a recalcitrant management.
 If the controlling owner is intelligent and self-confident, he will make
 decisions in respect to management that are meritocratic and pro-shareholder.
 Moreover-and this is critically important-he can readily correct any mistake
 he makes.

\begin_layout Itemize
A textile company that allocates capital brilliantly within its industry
 is a remarkable textile company - but not a remarkable business.
 Buffett's conclusion from his own experiences and from much observation
 of other businesses is that a good managerial record (measured by economic
 returns) is far more a function of what business boat you get into than
 it is of how effectively you row (though intelligence and effort help considera
bly, of course, in any business, good or bad).
 Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted
 to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted
 to patching leaks.
 Not all of Berkshire's businesses are destined to increase profits.
 When an industry's underlying economics are crumbling, talented management
 may slow the rate of decline.
 Eventually, though, eroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance.
 "If you want to get a reputation as a good businessman, be sure to get

\begin_layout Itemize
It's almost impossible, for example, in a boardroom populated by well-mannered
 people to raise the question of whether the CEO should be replaced.
 It's equally awkward to question a proposed acquisition that has been endorsed
 by the CEO, particularly when his inside staff and outside advisers are
 present and unanimously support his decision.
 (They wouldn't be in the room if they didn't.) Finally, when the compensation
 committee-armer, as always, with support from a high-paid consultant-reports
 on a mega-grant of options to the CEO, it would be like belching at the
 dinner table for a director to suggest that the committee reconsider.
 Buffett was, over a span of 40 years, on 19 public-company boards (excluding
 Berkshire's) and have interacted with perhaps 25 directors.
 The great majority of these directors lacked at least one of the 3 qualities
 he values (business-savvy, interested and shareholder-oriented).
 As a result, their contribution to shareholder well-being was minimal at
 best and, too often, negative.
 These people, decent and intelligent though they were, simply did not know
 enough about business and/or care enough about shareholders to question
 foolish acquisitions or egregious compensation.
 He was too often silent when management made proposals that he judged to
 be counter to the interests of shareholders.
 In those cases, collegiality trumped independence.

Directors and the entire board have many perfunctory duties, but in actuality

The best managers think like owners in making business decisions.
 They have shareholder interests at heart.
 But even first-rate managers will sometimes have interests that conflict
 with those of shareholders.
 The essays address some of the most important governance problems.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The first is the importance of forthrightness and candor in communications
 by managers to shareholders.
 Buffett prepares the content of the Berkshire's annual report using words
 and numbers people of average intelligence can understand; and all investors
 get the same information at the same time.
 Buffett and Berkshire avoid making predictions, a bad managerial habit
 that too often leads other managers to make up their financial reports.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What matters is selecting people who are able, honest, and hard-working.
 Having first-rate people on the team is more important than designing hierarchi
es and clarifying who reports to whom about what and at what times.
 Special attention must be paid to selecting a CEO because of 3 major difference
s Buffett identifies between CEOs and other employees.
 First, standards for measuring a CEO's performance are inadequate or easy
 to manipulate, so a CEO's performance is harder to measure than that of
 most workers.
 Second, no one is senior to the CEO, so no senior person's performance
 can be measured either.
 Third, a board of directors cannot serve that senior role since relations
 between CEOs and boards are conventionally congenial.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The best solution, Buffett instructs, is to take great care in identifying
 CEOs who will perform capably regardless of weak structural restraints.
 Large institutional shareholders must exercise their power to oust CEOs
 that do not measure up to the demands of corporate stewardship.
 Outstanding CEOs do not need a lot of coaching from owners, although they
 can benefit from having a similarly outstanding board.
 Directors therefore must be chosen for their business savvy, their interest,
 and their owner-orientation.
 According to Buffet, one of the greatest problems among boards in corporate
 America is that members are selected for other reasons, such as adding
 diversity or prominence to a board - or, famously, independence.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Director power is weakest in the case where there is a controlling shareholder
 who is also the manager.
 When disagreements arise between the directors and management, there is
 little a director can do other than to object and, in serious circumstances,
 resign.
 Director power is strongest at the other extreme, where there is a controlling
 shareholder who does not participate in management.
 The directors can take matters directly to the controlling shareholder
 when disagreement arises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most common situation, however, is a corporation without a controlling
 shareholder.
 This is where management problems are most acute, Buffett says.
 It would be helpful if directors could supply necessary discipline, but
 board congeniality usually prevents that.
 To maximize board effectiveness in this situation, Buffett believes the
 board should be small in size and composed mostly of outside directors.
 The strongest weapon a director can wield in these situations remains his
 or her threat to resign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All these situations do share a common characteristic: the terrible manager
 is a lot easier to confront or remove than the mediocre manager.
 A chief problem in all governance structures, Buffett emphasizes, is that
 in corporate America evaluation of chief executive officers is never conducted
 in regular meetings in the absence of that chief executive.
 Holding regular meetings without the chief executive to review his or her
 performance would be a marked improvement in corporate governance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The CEOs at Berkshire's various operating companies enjoy a unique position
 in corporate America.
 They are given a simple set of commands, to run their business as if:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
they are its sole owner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it is the only asset they hold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they can never sell or merge it for a hundred years
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This enables Berkshire CEOs to manage with a long-term horizon ahead of
 them, something alien to the CEOs of public companies whose short-term
 oriented shareholders obsess with meeting the latest quarterly earnings
 estimate.
 Short-term results matter, of course, but the Berkshire approach avoids
 any pressure to achieve them at the expense of strengthening long-term
 competitive advantages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buffett emphasizes that performance should be the basis for executive pay
 decisions.
 Executive performance should be measured by profitability, after profits
 are reduced by a charge for the capital employed in the relevant business
 or earnings retained by it.
 If stock options are used, they should be related to individual performance,
 rather than corporate performance, and priced based on business value.
 Better yet, as at Berkshire, stock options should simply not be part of
 an executive's compensation.
 After all, exceptional managers who earn cash bonuses based on the performance
 of their own business can simply buy stock if they want to; if they do,
 they "truly walk in the shoes of owners," Buffett says.

Some Technical Stock Measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is mostly from the book written by Jason Kelly.
 The idea is that we want to buy companies with solid fundamentals per the
 previous section, just as their stock prices show confirming signals per
 the tools in this section.
 It can be a good strategy to combine SMA, MACD, and RSI.
 Timing is, if not impossible, very difficult.
 However, anything offering a chance to avoid years like 2008 is worth exploring.
 Stay put most of the time to compound strong performance, but keep an eye
 on the chart to see if SMA, MACD, and RSI warn of big trouble ahead! When
 they do, you'll get out and wait for buy signals to take advantage of recovery
 on sale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Simple Moving Average (SMA)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Moving average of the stock's price and smooths out the bounciness of the
 raw price so you can better detect its trend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The position of the current price in relation to the SMA provides hints
 on where the price is heading next.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A price line's relationship to its SMA shows you its trend.
 If the price is staying above the SMA at a rising angle, that's rising
 trend, or uptrend.
 If the price is staying below the SMA at a falling angle, that's a falling
 trend, or downtrend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The easiest way to get buy and sell hints from this measure is to watch
 for when the investment's price line crosses above or below its SMA.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the investment is moving up, the SMA acts as a support line, and the
 price dipping below the line and moving back up signals a buy.
 When the investment is moving down, the SMA acts as a resistance line,
 and the price popping above the line and moving back down signals a sell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many traders use several moving averages together, such as a 20-day, 50-day,
 and a 200-day and watch for them to cross over each other for hints on
 future price direction.
 
\end_layout

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It compares the exponential moving average of a stock's price from two time
 periods, usually 12 and 26 days or weeks or months, and then plots that
 difference to show a trend.
 MACD is similar to SMA, but it places more weight on recent prices than
 on past ones, making it react more quickly to trend changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The MACD message is comprised of three parts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
MACD - the 12-period exponential moving average minus the 26-period.
 This is the difference between

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The period can refer to hours, days weeks, or months.
 Default is days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MACD Signal Line - The 9-period exponential moving average of the MACD.
 This is the trend of the difference between the 12-period and the 26-period
 trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MACD Histogram - The MACD minus the MACD Signal Line.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The main way to use MACD is by watching for the moving averages to cross
 over each other.
 A buy signal happens when the fast 12-period EMA crosses over the slow
 26-period EMA, which causes MACD to cross over the zero line.
 A sell signal happens when the fast 12-period EMA crosses below the slow
 26-period EMA, which causes MACD to cross below the zero line.
 Another way to use this curious collection of lines is to watch for the
 MACD to cross the MACD signal line, which flips the histogram to the opposite
 side of the zero line.
 Flipping above it is a buy signal; flipping below it is a sell signal.
 Histogram bars are the friendliest way to follow MACD.

Alerts you to when a stock's price has stretched too far in one direction

 When it stretches too far up, it's called overbought.
 When it stretches too far down, it's called oversold.

It fluctuates between 0 and 100.
 Most commonly, anything higher than 70 is considered overbought and due
 for a pullback, and anything lower than 30 oversold and due for a bounce.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Like SMA and MACD, RSI needs a time frame.
 The default is a 14-period time frame, and the periods can be again hours,
 days, weeks, or anything else, but usually days.

 It's a good indicator of how much interest people have in the stock.
 That's important to know because the stock market is greatly affected by
 supply and demand.
 If everybody wants to buy a certain stock, its price will rise.
 If nobody wants it, the price will fall.
 Some investors like to buy stocks with low volume, hoping that major institutio
ns will discover them and begin trading heavily.
 Lots of investors watch stock volume in an attempt to catch trends early.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Volume is measured in either the number of shares traded or the dollar amount
 that is moved as a result of that trading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The strongest signal from volume occurs when it surges higher as the stock
 price moves.
 Rising volume on a rising stock price shows something good going on at
 the company.
 Rising volume on a falling stock price shows something bad.
 The stronger the volume, the more persistent the stock's price trend.

Most young growth companies tend to be privately owned and funded by their
 founder/owner or by venture capitalists.
 In the last two decades, though, companies in some sectors such as technology
 and biotechnology have been able to leapfrog the process and to public.
 When they do go public, they offer a blend of promise and peril to investors
 who are willing to grapple with the uncertainties that come with growth
 potential.

 - survival at skills - for young firms to become valuable, they have to
 survive.
 What is the likelihood that your firm will not make it? 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Young companies share some common attributes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
No historical performance data.
 Most have maybe 1-2 years of data available on operations and financing
 and some have financials for only a portion of a year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Small or no revenues, operating losses.
 Many young companies have small or nonexistent revenues.
 Expenses often are associated with getting the business established, rather
 than generating revenues.
 In combination, the result is significant operating losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many don't survive.
 One study concluded that only 44% of all businesses that were founded in
 1998 survived at least 4 years and only 31% made it through 7 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investments are illiquid.
 Even those publicly traded have small market capitalization and relatively
 few shares traded (low float).
 A significant portion of the equity is usually held by the founders, venture
 capitalists, and other private equity investors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple claims on equity.
 It is not uncommon for some equity investors to have first claims on cash
 flows (dividends) and others to have additional voting right shares.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Success with an existing product can sometimes provide an opening for a
 firm to introduce a new product.
 The success of the iPod laid the foundations for the introduction of the
 iPhone and the iPad for Apple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Companies that succeed with a product in one market may be able to expand
 into other markets with similar success.
 The most obvious example of this is expanding into foreign markets to build
 on domestic market success, a pathway adopted by companies like Coca Cola,
 McDonald's, and many retail companies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most investors and analysts give up, it's very difficult to valuate them,
 especially if those characteristics come together in the same firm.
 Existing assets often generate little or negative cash flows, and estimating
 future revenues and discount rates becomes more difficult because of limited
 or nonexistent historical data.
 And a firm may not survive to become a stable firm and there may be multiple
 claims on equity.
 As a consequence, most investors don't even try to value young growth companies
 on an intrinsic basis and rely instead on compelling stories to justify
 investment decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some analysts try to value young companies using multiples and comparables.
 However, this task is also made more difficult by the following factors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What do you scale value to? If a firm is losing money, there is little to
 show in terms of book value and have minuscule revenues.
 Scaling market value to any of these variables is going to be difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What are your comparable companies? Even if a young company operates in
 a sector where there are many other young companies, there can be significant
 variations across companies.
 For young companies in mature sectors, the task will be even more challenging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How do you control for survival? Intuitively, we would expect the relative
 value of a young company (the multiple of revenues or earnings that we
 assign it) to increase with its likelihood of survival.
 However, putting this intuitive principle into practice is not easy to
 do.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Paragraph

Intrinsic valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimating future cash flows - there are 3 key numbers in forecasting future
 cash flows.
 The first is revenue growth, which can be obtained by either extrapolating
 from the recent past or by estimating the total market for a product or
 service and an expected market share.
 The potential market for a company will be smaller, if the product or service
 offered by the firm is defined narrowly, and will expand if we use a broader
 definition.
 The next step is to estimate the share of that market that will be captured
 by the firm being analyzed, both in the long term and in the time periods
 leading up to it.
 It is at this stage that you will consider both the quality of the products
 and management of the young company and the resources that the company
 can draw on to accomplish its objectives.
 A firm can have value only if it ultimately delivers earnings.
 Consequently, the next step is estimating the operating expenses associated
 with delivering the projected revenues, and we would separate the estimation
 process into 2 parts.
 In the first part, we'd focus on estimating the target operating margin
 when the firm becomes mature, primarily by looking at more established
 companies in the business.
 In the second part, we can then look at how the margin will evolve over
 time; this "pathway to profitability" can be rockier for some firms than
 others, with fixed costs and competition playing significant roles in the
 estimation.
 The product of the forecasted revenues and expected operating margins yields
 the expected operating income.
 To estimate taxes used on this income, consider the possibility of carrying
 forward operating losses from earlier years to offset income in later years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimating discount rates - there are two problems that we face in estimating
 discount rates for young companies.
 The first is that the market history available is too short and volatile
 to yield reliable estimates of beta or cost of debt.
 The second is that the cost of capital can be expected to change over time
 as the young company matures.
 To overcome the lack of history, we would suggest an approach that looks
 past the company and focuses instead at the business the company operates
 in, and adjusting for key differences.
 In effect, we use sector averages for discount rates, adjusted for the
 higher risk of younger companies.
 Thus, in the yearly years, costs of equity and capital will be much higher
 for young companies than for more mature counterparts in the same business.
 To incorporate the changes over time, move the cost of capital toward sector
 averages, as the young company grows and matures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimating value today and adjusting for survival - once cash flows for
 the forecast period have been estimated and discounted, you still have
 to determine what will happen at the end of the forecast period, adjust
 the value for the possibility of failure, and examine the impact of losing
 key people in the company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Terminal value - it can be 80, 90, or even more than 100% of value for a
 young firm; the more than 100% will occur when cash flows are very negative
 in the near years, requiring fresh capital infusions.
 The basic principles that govern terminal value remain unchanged: the growth
 rate used has to be less than the growth rate of the economy, the cost
 of capital has to converge on that of a mature firm, and there has to be
 enough reinvestment to sustain the stable growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adjust for survival - to deal with the risk of failure in a young firm,
 try a two-step approach.
 In the first step, value the firm on the assumption that it survives and
 makes it to financial health.
 This, in effect, is what we are assuming when we use a terminal value and
 discount cash flows back to today at a risk-adjusted discount rate.
 In the second step, bring in the likelihood that the firm will not survive.
 The probability of failure can be assessed most simply, by using sector
 averages.
 These sector averages can then be adjusted for specifics about the firm
 being valued: the quality of its management, its access to capital, and
 its cash balances.
 The value of the firm can be written as an expected value of the two scenarios
 - the intrinsic value (from the discounted cash flows) under the going
 concern scenario and the distress value under the failure scenario.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Key person discounts - young companies, especially in service business,
 are often dependent upon the owner or a few key people for their success.
 Consequently, the value we estimate for these businesses can change significant
ly if one or more of these key people will no longer be associated with
 the firm.
 To assess a key person discount in valuations, first value the firm with
 the status quo (with key people involved in the business), and then value
 it again with the loss of these individuals built into revenues, earnings,
 and expected cash flows.
 To the extent that earnings and cash flows suffer when key people leave,
 the value of the business will be lower with the loss of these individuals,
 thus leading to a "key person discount".
 But sometimes its a key technology, not key people that matters more in
 terms of the value.

It's more challenging with young firms that have little to show in terms
 of operations and face substantial risks in operations and threats to their
 existence for the following reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Life cycle affects fundamentals: to the extent that we are comparing a young
 firm to more mature firms in the business, there are likely to be significant
 differences in risk, cash flows, and growth across the firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Survival: a related point is that there is a high probability of failure
 in young firms.
 Firms that are mature and have a lower probability of failure should therefore
 trade at higher market values, for any given variable such as revenues,
 earnings, or book value, holding all else (growth and risk) constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scaling variable: young firms often have very little revenues to show in
 the current year and many will be losing money; the book value is usually
 meaningless.
 Applying a multiple to any one of these measures will result in outlandish
 numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Liquidity: since equity in publicly traded companies is often more liquid
 than equity in young growth companies, the value obtained by using these
 mutiples may be too high if applied to a young company.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are simple practices that can not only prevent egregious valuation
 errors but also lead to better valuations:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Use forward revenues/earnings: since young firms often have small revenues
 and negative earnings, one solution is to forecast the operating results
 of the firm further down the life cycle and use these forward revenues
 and earnings as the basis for valuation.
 In effect, we will estimate the value of the business in 5 years, using
 revenues or earnings from that point in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adjust the multiple for the firm's characteristics at the forward period:
 check expectations in revenue growth for example and see the larger, mature
 firms in the sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adjust for time value and survival risk: when forward multiples are used
 to derive value, we need to adjust for the time value of money and the
 likelihood that the firm will not survive to get to the forward value.
 You need to incorporate the expected revenues for a firm, applying the
 sector average multiple, and adjust for the likelihood of failure.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are many reasons why young growth companies fail: revenue growth may
 lag, target margins may be lower than expected, capital markets may shut
 down, or key people may leave.
 Investors can improve their odds of success by focusing on the following
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Big potential markets: it has to be large enough to absorb high revenue
 growth for an extended period, without being overwhelmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Expense tracking and controls: young companies can become undisciplined
 in tracking and controlling expenses, while chasing growth.
 Set targets for margin improvement and view failure to meet these targets
 as reasons to sell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Access to capital: this is critical to both growth and success.
 Look for firms with larger cash balances and institutional investor bases
 because they are better positioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dependence on key individuals: young firms are often dependent upon key
 individuals or founders.
 Focus on firms that have built up a solid bench to back up key personnel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exclusivity: success will attract competition, often from larger companies
 with deep pockets.
 You want young firms that have products that are difficult for others to
 imitate, whether this exclusivity comes from patents, technology, or brand
 name.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In summary, you want to invest in young companies with tough-to-imitate
 products that have huge potential markets, are working at keeping expenses
 under control, and have access to capital.

Growth firms get more of their value from investments that they expect to
 make in the future and less from investments already made.

 cost of capital.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Size disconnect: the market values of growth companies, if they are publicly
 traded, are often much higher than the book values, since markets incorporate
 the value of growth assets and accountants do not.
 In addition, the market values can seem discordant with the operating numbers

 Many growth firms have market values in the billions, while reporting small
 revenues and negative earnings.

\begin_layout Itemize
Use of debt: growth firms in any business will tend to carry less debt,
 relative to their value (intrinsic or market), than more stable firms in
 the same business, simply because they do not have the cash flows from
 existing assets to support more debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Market history is short and unstable: even if growth companies are publicly
 traded, they generally have stock price data going back for only short
 periods, and even that data is unstable.

\begin_layout Itemize
If the intrinsic value of a company comes from its cash flows and risk character
istics, there are problems that can be traced back to where growth firms
 are in the life cycle.
 The biggest challenge that we face in valuing growth companies stems from
 changing scale.
 Even in the most successful growth company, we can expect future growth
 to be lower than past growth for two reasons.
 One is that a company that has posted a growth rate of 80% over the last
 5 years is larger (by a factor of 18) than it was five years ago, and it
 is unlikely to maintain that growth rate.
 The other is that growth attracts competition which, in turn, crimps growth.
 Questions about how quickly growth rates will scale down going forward,
 and how the risk and other characteristics of the firm will change as growth
 changes, are at the center of growth company valuation.

Issues and problems:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Comparable firms: even if all of the companies in a sector are growth firms,
 they can vary widely in terms of risk and growth characteristics, thus
 making it difficult to generalize from industry averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Base year values and choice of multiples: if a firm is a growth firm, the
 current values for scaling variables such as earnings, book value, or revenues
 may provide limited or unreliable clues to the future potential for the
 firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Controlling for growth differences: not only does the level of growth make
 a difference to value, but so does the length of the growth period and
 the excess returns that accompany that growth rate.
 Put another way, two companies with the same expected growth rate in earnings
 can trade at very different multiples of these earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Controlling for risk differences: determining how the trade-off between
 growth and risk will affect value is difficult to do in any valuation but
 becomes doubly so in relative valuation, where many companies have both
 high growth and high risk.

Intrinsic valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The DCF models used to value growth companies need to allow for changing
 growth and margins over time.
 Consequently, models that lock in the current characteristics of the company
 do not perform as well as more flexible models, where analysts can change
 the inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Valuing the operating assets: The valuation process starts with estimating
 future revenues.
 The biggest issue is the scaling factor.
 The question of how quickly revenue growth rates will decline at a given
 company, as it gets bigger, can generally be addressed by looking at the
 company's specifics - the size of the overall market for its products and
 services, the strength of the competition, and the quality of both its
 products and management.
 Companies with larger potential markets with less aggressive competition
 and better management can maintain high revenue growth rates for longer
 periods.
 To get from revenues to operating income, we need operating margins over
 time.
 In many growth firms, the current operating margin will be either negative
 or very low, largely because up-front fixed costs associated with infrastructur
e investments as well as selling expenses directed towards getting new clients
 (and future growth) are counted in the current year's expenses.
 As the company grows, margins should improve.
 Conversely, some growth companies enjoy super-high margins because they
 have niche products in markets too small to attract the attention of larger,
 better-capitalized competitors.
 As the firm grows, this will change and margins will decrease, as competitors
 emerge.
 Under Armour's success with microfiber apparel is a good example; in the
 initial years, larger players like Nike ignored it but are now introducing
 their own competing products.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In both scenarios - low margins converging to a higher value, or high margins
 dropping back to more sustainable levels - we have to make judgment calls
 on what the target margin should be and how the current margin will change
 over time towards this target.
 The answer to the first question can usually be found by looking at both
 the average operating margins commanded by larger more stable firms in
 that industry.
 The answer to the second will depend upon the reason for the divergence
 between the current margin and the target margin.
 With infrastructure companies, for instance, it will reflect how long it
 will take for the investment to be operational and capacity to be fully
 utilized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In keeping with the theme that firms have to reinvest in order to grow,
 we will follow one of three paths to estimate reinvestment.
 The first and most general approach is to estimate the reinvestment using
 the change in revenue and a sales-to-capital ratio, estimated using either
 historical data for the firm or industry averages.
 For growth firms that have a more established record of earnings and reinvestme
nt, we can estimate the growth rate as a product of the reinvestment rate
 and the return on capital on these investments.
 Finally, growth firms that have already invested in capacity for future
 years are in the unusual position of being able to grow with little or
 no reinvestment for the near term.
 For these firms, we can forecast capacity usage to determine how long the
 investment holiday will last and when the firm will have to reinvest again.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Risk profile consistent with growth and operating numbers - while the components
 of the cost of capital are the same for a growth company as they are for
 a mature company, what sets growth companies apart is that their risk profiles
 will shift over time.
 As general rules:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Growth firms should have high costs for equity and debt when revenue growth
 is highest, but the costs of debt and equity should decline as revenue
 growth moderates and margins improve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As earnings increase and growth drops, the firm will generate more cash
 flows than it needs, which it can use to not only pay dividends but also
 to service debt.
 While firms are not required to use this debt capacity, the tax advantages
 of debt will lead some firms to borrow, causing debt ratios to increase
 over time.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Steady state: when and what? The assumption about terminal value loom large
 with a growth company, since it will comprise a much larger portion of
 the firm's current value than is the case with a mature firm.
 Assessing when a growth firm will become a stable company is difficult
 to do, but keep in mind the following general propositions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Do not wait too long to put a firm into stable growth.
 Both scale and competition conspire to lower growth rates quickly at even
 the most promising growth companies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you put firm into stable growth, give it the characteristics of a stable
 growth firm: with discount rates, as we noted in the last section, this
 will take the form of using lower costs of debt and equity and a higher
 debt ratio.
 With reinvestment, the key assumption will be the return on capital that
 we assume for the stable growth phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Stable reinvestment rate = stable growth rate / stable period return on
 capital
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While some analysts believe that the return on capital should be set equal
 to the cost of capital in stable growth, we would preserve some company-specifi
c flexibility and suggest that the difference between return on capital
 and cost of capital should narrow during stable growth to a sustainable
 level.

From operating asset value to equity value per share: to get from operating
 asset value to equity value per share add back the cash balance at the
 company, subtract out debt outstanding, and subtract out management options,
 before dividing by the number of shares outstanding.
 This estimate is based on the assumption that the shares are all equivalent
 on dividend and voting rights.
 Some growth firms continue to be controlled by their founder, who maintains
 control by holding on to shares with disproportionate voting rights.
 If that is the case, you have to adjust for the fact that voting shares
 trade at a premium over nonvoting shares; studies indicate that the premium
 is about 5-10% at U.S.
 companies.

Relative valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Analysts valuing growth companies tend to use either revenue multiples or
 forward earnings multiples.
 Each carries some danger.
 Revenue multiples are troubling simply because they gloss over the fact
 that the company being valued could be losing significant amounts of money.
 Consequently, we would suggest bringing the expected future profit margins
 into the discussion of what comprises a reasonable multiple of revenues.
 Forward earnings multiples implicitly assume that the firm being valued
 will survive to the forward year and that the estimates of earnings for
 that year are reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With growth firms, no matter how careful you are about constructing a set
 of comparable firms and picking the right multiple, there will be significant
 differences across the firms on both the level and the quality of expected
 growth.

\end_layout

Statistical approaches: when firms vary not only on expected growth, but
 also on the quality of that growth and risk, the first two approaches become

 across firms on these dimensions.

For a growth company to succeed, it has to scale up growth while preserving
 profit margins.
 Expected revenue growth rates will tend to drop over time for all growth
 companies, but the pace of the drop will vary across companies.
 For investing in growth companies to pay off, here are a few things to
 look for:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Scalable growth: as a firm becomes larger, growth rates will decline.
 Focus on firms that are able to diversify their product offerings and cater
 to a wider customer base as they grow.
 They will see more growth as they scale up than firms that do not have
 this capability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sustainable margins: as firms become successful, there will be increased
 competition.
 Look for firms that are able to preserve profit margins and returns as
 they grow.
 Steer away from firms that have to trade off lower margins and returns
 for higher growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The right price: great growth companies can be bad investments at the wrong
 price.
 While multiples as PEG ratios have their limitations, use them to screen
 for companies that are cheap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Time is your ally.
 Even the most worthy growth company will disappoint investors at some point,
 delivering earnings that do not match up to lofty expectations.
 When that happens, there will be investors who overreact, dumping their
 shares, and embarking on their search for the next great growth story.
 The drop in price will offer you an opportunity to pick up the company
 at the right price.

Some companies such as Coca Cola have been around for generations.
 They should be easy to value, since they have long periods of operating

 But not all long standing practice is good and it is possible that changing
 the way these companies are run can make a difference in creating higher
 stock values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If growth companies get the bulk of their value from growth assets, mature
 companies must get the bulk of their value from existing investments.
 If we define mature companies thus, the threshold for being a mature company
 will vary across markets and across time (the threshold will be higher,
 when economies slow down as they did in 2008 and 2009, and lower when economies
 are booming).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The common characteristics of mature companies are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Revenue growth is approaching growth rate in the economy.
 While the growth rate for earnings for mature firms can be high, at least
 in some years, mature firms will register growth rates in revenues that,
 if not equal to, will converge on the nominal growth rate for the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Margins are established.
 Mature companies tend to have stable margins, with the exceptions being
 commodity and cyclical firms, where margins will vary as a function of
 macroeconomic variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Diverse competitive advantages.
 While some mature firms see excess returns go to zero or become negative,
 other mature firms retain significant competitive advantages (and excess
 returns).
 For instance, Coca Cola uses its brand name to continue to deliver high
 returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Debt capacity.
 With more cash available for servicing debt, debt capacity should increase
 for mature firms, though there can be big differences in how firms react
 to this surge in debt capacity.
 Some will choose not to exploit any or most of the debt capacity and stick
 with financing policies that they established as growth companies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cash build-up and return.
 As earnings improve and reinvestment needs drop off, mature companies will
 be generating more cash from their operations than they need.
 If these companies do not pay more dividends, cash balances will start
 accumulating in these firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Acquisition-driven growth.
 As companies get larger and internal investment opportunities do not provide
 the growth boost that they are used to, one quick fix used by these firms
 is to buy growth: acquisitions of other companies can provide boosts to
 revenues and earnings, though not always to value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Not all mature companies are large companies.
 Many small companies reach their growth ceiling quickly and essentially
 stay on as small mature firms.

\begin_layout Itemize
Valuation issues
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When valuing these companies, investors are often lulled into believing
 that the numbers from the past (operating margins, returns on capital)
 are reasonable estimates of what existing assets will continue to generate
 in the future.
 However, past earnings reflect how the firm was manager over the period.
 To the extent that mangers may not have made the right investment or financing
 choices, the reported earnings may be lower than what would be generated
 under better management.
 If such a management change is on the horizon, investors will undervalue
 existing assets using reported numbers.
 A secondary challenge is that mature companies are more likely to turn
 to acquisitions for growth.
 As a general rule, the value of acquisition-driven growth is much more
 difficult to assess than the value of internal or organic growth.
 With mature companies, you have a luxury of riches with it comes to relative
 valuation.
 You can estimate revenues, earnings, and book value multiples and compare
 how company is priced relative to other companies like it, but challenges
 remain.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Too many choices.
 The same company can be assigned very different values, depending upon
 whether we are using a firm or equity multiple, whether that multiple is
 stated as a function of revenues, earnings, and book value, and the companies
 we pick to be its comparables.
 With mature firms, the problem we face is not that we cannot estimate a
 relative value but that there are too many values to pick from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Management change.
 The multiples that we compute of revenues, earnings, and book value reflect
 the firm as it is managed today.
 To the extent that changing the management of the firm could change these
 numbers, we will undervalue badly managed firms with current numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Acquisition noise.
 The accounting aftermath of acquisitions - the creation of goodwill as
 an asset and its subsequent treatment - can affect both earnings and book
 value, making multiples based on either number dicey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changing financial leverage.
 Mature companies are capable of making large changes to their debt ratios
 overnight - debt for equity swaps, recapitalizations - and equity multiples,
 such as PE and price-to-book ratios, will change more than enterprise value
 or firm multiples as financial leverage changes.
 A stock buyback, funded with debt, can reduce equity dramatically (by reducing
 the shares outstanding), but will have a much smaller impact on enterprise
 value (since we are replacing equity with debt).
 For the same reason, equity earnings (earnings per share, net income) will
 change when firms alter debt ratios.

Valuation solutions
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If the key to valuing mature companies is assessing the potential increase
 in value from changing the way they are run, these changes can be categorized
 broadly into 3 groups: changes in operations, changes in financial structure,
 and changes in non-operating assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Operating restructuring.
 When valuing a company, our forecasts of earnings and cash flows are built
 on assumptions about how the company will be run.
 The value of the operating assets of the firm is a function of three variables:
 cash flows from assets in place, expected growth, and the length of the
 growth period - and each can be altered by management policies.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Cash flow from existing assets.
 If existing investments are being operated inefficiently, cutting costs
 and improving employee productivity or redeploying assets to new uses can
 increase cash flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Expected growth rate.
 Firms can increase their long-term growth by either reinvesting more (higher
 reinvestment rate) or reinvesting better (higher return on capital).
 They can also improve returns on existing assets to generate short term
 growth.
 For mature firms with low return on capital (especially when returns are
 less than the cost of capital), extracting more growth from existing assets
 is likely to yield results, at least in the short term.
 For smaller firms with relatively few assets in place that are generating
 reasonable returns, growth has to come from new investments that generate
 healthy returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Length of the high growth period.
 The longer a firm can maintain high growth and excess returns, the higher
 will be its value.
 One way firms can increase value is by augmenting existing barriers to
 entry and coming up with new competitive advantages.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Value plays - there are two value plays with mature companies.
 The first is the classic "passive value" strategy that traces its roots
 to Ben Graham and Warren Buffet, where you invest in "well managed" companies
 that deliver solid earnings and reasonable growth, but which investors
 have turned sour on, either in reaction to a recent news event (earnings
 report) or because these firms are not the flavor of the moment or are
 boring.
 Another way to profit from these companies - and this is a more perverse
 strategy - is to look for those firms that are poorly managed but could
 be worth more under better management.
 To find these companies, consider the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Performance indicators: the worse managed a firm is, the greater the potential
 for increasing value.
 Look for firms with low operating margins relative to the sector, low returns
 on capital relative to cost of capital, and very low debt ratios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Potential for management change: you have to change management for value
 to increase.
 Search for companies where the field is not tilted in management's favor
 (with voting right differences or anti-takeover amendments) and where managemen
t change, if not imminent, is at least possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Early warning system.
 If everyone else in the market sees what you do (potential for value and
 management change), you will not gain much.
 Focus on firms where there is a catalyst for management change - an aging
 CEO, a new investor on the board of directors, or a change in the corporate
 charter.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you are right in your assessment, you don't have to wait for the management
 change to happen.
 The payoff on your investment will occur when the rest of the market recognizes
 that change is likely and pushes up the stock price to reflect that change.

As companies age and see their markets shrink and investment opportunities
 dissipate, they enter the final phase of the life cycle, which is decline.
 While investors and analysts often avoid these firms, they may offer lucrative
 investment opportunities for long-term investors with strong stomachs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Growth companies do not want to become mature companies and mature companies
 constantly try to rediscover their growth roots.
 By the same token, no mature company wants to go into decline, with the
 accompanying loss of earnings and value.
 So, how would we differentiate between mature firms and firms in decline?
 Firms in decline generally have little in terms of growth potential and
 even their existing assets often deliver returns lower than their cost
 of capital; they are value destroying.
 The best case scenario is for orderly decline and liquidation and the worst
 case is that they go bankrupt, unable to cover debt obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Decline companies tend to share common characteristics, and these shared
 features create problems for analysts trying to value these firms.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Stagnant of declining revenues.
 Flat revenues or revenues that grow at less than the inflation rate are
 an indicator of operating weakness.
 It is even more telling if these patterns in revenues apply not only to
 the company being analyzed but to the overall sector, thus eliminating
 the explanation that the weakness is due to poor management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Shrinking or negative margins.
 Declining firms often lose pricing power and see their margins shrink,
 as they lose market share to more aggressive competitors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Asset divestitures.
 Since existing assets are sometimes worth more to other investors, who
 intent to put them to different and better uses, asset divestitures will
 be more frequent at declining firms, and especially so if these firms owe
 money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Big payouts - dividends and stock buybacks.
 Declining firms have little need for reinvestment and are thus often able
 to pay out large dividends, sometimes exceeding their earnings, and also
 buy back stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Financial leverage - the downside.
 If debt is a double-edged sword, declining firms often are exposed to the
 wrong edge.
 With stagnant and declining earnings from existing assets and little potential
 for earnings growth, debt burdens can become overwhelming.

Valuation Issues
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The historical data is depressing, with existing investments generating
 flat or even declining revenues accompanied by falling margins.
 In the aggregate, the company may be generating returns on capital that
 are less than its cost of capital.
 Rather than investing in new assets, the firm may be shedding assets and
 shrinking, altering both its asset mix and often its financing mix.
 As the business and financing mix of the firm changes, its risk characteristics
 will also change, altering its costs of equity and capital.
 Even if you overcome these challenges and estimate expected cash flow for
 a declining firm, you have to consider the possibility that the firm being
 valued will not make it to stable growth; many distressed firms will default
 and go out of business or be liquidated.
 Even if a firm is expected to survive, the expected growth rate in perpetuity
 may not only be well below the growth rate of the economy and inflation,
 but also in some cases it can even be negative.
 Essentially, the firm will continue to exist but get progressively smaller
 over time as its market shrinks.

Issues when using multiples and comparable firms:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

 the challenge is working out a discount for the declining firm relative
 to the values being attached to healthy firms.

 to consider how best to adjust for the degree of decline in a firm.

Is the decline in firm's operations reversible or permanent? If reversible,
 you estimate revenues, operating margins, and taxes for the firm, on the
 assumption that the firm will recover to health, operating under the constraint
 that it will be limited in its capacity to reinvest.
 In making these estimates, you have to be realistic in considering what
 health will look like for the declining firm - it may very well require
 firm to shrink and settle for little or no growth in the long term.
 When estimating discount rates, you have to assume that debt ratios will,
 in fact, decrease over time if the firm is over levered, and that the firm
 will derive tax benefits from debt as it turns the corner toward profitability.
 This is consistent with the assumption that the firm will remain a going
 concern.

Investors with long time horizons and strong stomachs can use two strategies
 with declining companies.
 The first is to invest in declining companies, where the decline is inevitable
 and management recognizes that fact.
 While there will be little price appreciation from our equity investments,
 you will get large cash flows, as assets are divested and the cash used
 for dividends and stock buybacks.
 In effect, your stock will behave like a high-yield bond.
 The second is to make a turnaround play, where you invest in declining
 or distressed companies with the hope that they revert back to health and,
 in the process, deliver substantial upside.
 To pull off this strategy, you should consider the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Operating potential: a firm with solid operating assets can become distressed
 because of its overuse of debt.
 Search for over-levered firms with valuable assets, in otherwise healthy
 business.
 
\end_layout

Debt restructuring: for over-levered firms to recover, there has to be a
 reduction in the debt burden, coming either from improving operating performanc

 Look for firms where debt restructuring is being actively pursued and where
 the likelihood of success is high.

\begin_layout Itemize
Valuation Issues
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are two primary challenges in valuing banks, investment banks, or
 insurance companies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Drawing a distinction between debt and equity is difficult for financial
 service firms.
 When measuring capital for non-financial service firms, we tend to include
 both debt and equity.
 With a financial service firm, debt has a different connotation.
 Debt to a bank is raw material, something to be molded into other products
 that can then be sold at a higher price and yield a profit.
 In fact, the definition of what comprises debt also is murkier with a financial
 service firm than it is with a non-financial service firm, since deposits
 made by customers into their checking accounts at a bank technically meet
 the criteria for debt.
 Consequently, capital at financial service firms has to be narrowly defined
 as including only equity capital, a definition reinforced by the regulatory
 authorities, who evaluate the equity capital ratios of banks and insurance
 firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Defining cash flow for a bank is also difficult, even if it is defined as
 cash flows to equity.
 Measuring net capital expenditures and working capital can be problematic.
 Unlike manufacturing firms that invest in plan, equipment, and other fixed
 assets, financial service firms invest primarily in intangible assets such
 as brand name and human capital.
 Consequently, their investments for future growth often are treated as
 operating expenses in accounting statements.
 If we define working capital as the difference between current assets and
 current liabilities, a large proportion of a bank's balance sheet would
 fall into one or the other of these categories.
 Changes in this number can be both large and volatile and may have no relations
hip to reinvestment fur future growth.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are also problems with relative valuation - multiples based upon enterpris
e value are very difficult, if not impossible, to compute for financial
 service firms.
 Controlling for differences in growth and risk is also more difficult,
 largely because accounting statements are opaque.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you cannot clearly delineate how much a financial service firm owes and
 what its cash flows are, how can you ever get an estimate of value? We
 deploy the same techniques in both intrinsic and relative valuation to
 overcome these problems - we value equity (rather than the firm) and use
 dividends, the only observable cash flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series bold
Intrinsic Valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you accept the propositions that capital at a bank should be narrowly
 defined to include only equity, and that cash flows to equity are difficult
 (if not impossible) to compute because net capital expenditures and working
 capital cannot be defined, you are left with only one option - the dividend
 discount model.
 For a stable growth dividend-paying firm, the value of a stock can be written
 as follows: value of equity = expected dividends next year / (cost of equity
 - expected growth rate)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
cost of equity - for discounting cash flows, with the possibility that the
 cost may vary across time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the proportion of earnings that we assume will be paid out in dividends
 - this is the dividend payout ratio, and higher payout ratios will translate
 into more dividends for any given level of earnings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
expected growth rate in dividends over time, which will be a function of
 the earnings growth rate and the accompanying payout ratio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we also have to make sure that the inputs are consistent with each other
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There is an inherent trade-off between dividends and growth.
 When a company pays a larger segment of its earnings as dividends, it is
 reinvesting less and should thus grow more slowly.
 With financial service firms, this link is reinforced by the fact that
 the activities of these firms are subject to regulatory capital constraints;
 banks and insurance companies have to maintain equity (in book value terms)
 at specified percentages of their activities.
 When a company is paying out more in dividends, it is retaining less in
 earnings; the book value of equity increases by the retained earnings.
 In recent years, in keeping with a trend that is visible in other sectors
 as well, financial service firms have increased stock buybacks as a way
 of returning cash to stockholders.
 In this context, focusing purely on dividends paid can provide a misleading
 picture of the cash returned to stockholders.
 An obvious solution is to add the stock buybacks each year to the dividends
 paid and to compute the composite payout ratio.
 If we do so, however, we should look at the number over several years,
 since stock buybacks vary widely across time - a buyback of billions in
 one year may be followed by three years of relatively meager buybacks for
 instance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To ensure that assumptions about dividends, earnings and growth are internally
 consistent, we have to bring in a measure of how well the retained equity
 is reinvested; the return on equity is the variable that ties together
 payout ratios and expected growth:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
expected growth in earnings = return on equity * (1-dividend payout ratio)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The linkage between return on equity, growth, and dividends is therefore
 critical in determining value in a financial service firm.
 At the risk of hyperbole, the key number in valuing a bank is not dividends,
 earnings, or expected growth, but what we believe it will earn as return
 on equity in the long term.
 That number, in conjunction with payout ratios, will help in determining
 growth.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
expected ROE = current ROE / (1 + % increase in capital which is our assumption)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
expected growth rate = expected ROE / 1 - payout ratio 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The linkage between growth, payout, and ROE is also useful when we get to
 stable growth, since the payout ratio that we use in stable growth, to
 estimate the terminal value, should be:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
payout ratio in stable growth = 1 - (expected growth rate / stable period
 ROE)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
terminal price = (EPS in year X * stable payout ratio) / (cost of equity
 - expected growth rate)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
where year X is the last year of our forecast
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Cash flow to equity models: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to estimate cash flows to equity for financial service firms,
 if you define reinvestment differently.
 With financial service firms, the reinvestment generally is in regulatory
 capital; this is the capital as defined by the regulatory authorities,
 which in turn, determines the limits on future growth.
 cash flow to equity = (expected next year) net income - reinvestment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Where reinvestment = loans outstanding * (1 + loan growth over the year)
 * % increase/decrease in regulatory capital ratio MINUS book value of equity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This cash flow to equity can be considered a potential dividend and replace
 dividends in the DDM.
 Generalizing from this example banks that have regulatory capital shortfalls
 should be worth less than banks that have built up safety buffers, since
 the former will need to reinvest more to get capital ratios back to target
 levels.
 Conservative banks may choose to maintain higher capital ratios than required
 by regulatory authorities, whereas aggressive banks may push towards the
 regulatory constraints.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Excess return models 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The third approach to valuing financial service firms is to use an excess
 return model, where excess returns are defined as the difference between
 ROE and the cost of equity.
 In such a model, the value of equity in a firm can be written as the sum
 of the book value of equity the value added by expected excess returns
 to equity investors from these and future investments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
value of equity = equity capital invested currently + present value of expected
 excess returns to equity investors
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The most interesting aspect of this model is its focus on excess returns.
 A firm that invests its equity and earns just the fair-market rate of return
 on these investments should see the market value of its equity converge
 on the equity capital currently invested in it.
 A firm that earns a below-market return on its equity investments will
 see its equity market value dip below the equity capital currently invested.
 The two key inputs into the excess return model are the return on equity
 and the cost of equity.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Excess equity return = (return on equity - cost of equity ) * equity capital
 invested
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
present value of excess returns = book value of equity * (1 + return on
 equity - cost of equity)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
value for equity = present value of excess returns + book value of equity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
now you can divide it by # of shares and you can compare it with DDM
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Paragraph

\series bold
Relative Valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PE - as with other firms, it should be higher for financial service firms
 with higher expected growth rates in earnings, higher payout ratios, and
 lower costs of equity.
 An issue that is specific to financial service firms is the use of provisions
 for expected expenses.
 For instance, banks routinely set aside provisions for bad loans.
 These provisions reduce the reported income and affect the reported P/E
 ratio.
 Consequently, banks that are more conservative about categorizing bad loans
 will report lower earnings, whereas banks that are less conservative will
 report higher earnings.
 Another consideration in the use of earnings multiples is the diversification
 of financial service firms into multiple businesses.
 The multiple that an investor is willing to pay for a dollar in earnings
 from commercial lending should be very different from the multiple that
 the same investor is willing to pay for a dollar in earnings from trading.
 When a firm is in many businesses with different risk, growth, and return
 characteristics, it is very difficult to find truly comparable firms and
 to compare the multiples of earnings paid across firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PB - other things remaining equal, higher growth rates in earnings, higher
 payout ratios, lower costs of equity, and higher returns on equity should
 all result in higher P/B ratio, with return on equity being the dominant
 variable.
 If anything, the strength of the relationship between P/B and returns on
 equity should be stronger for financial service firms than for other firms,
 because the book value of equity is much more likely to track the market
 value of existing assets.
 While emphasizing the relationship between P/B ratios and returns on equity,
 don't ignore the other fundamentals.
 For instance, banks vary in terms of risk, and we would expect for any
 given return on equity that riskier banks should have lower P/B ratios.
 Similarly, banks with much greater potential for growth should have much
 higher P/B ratios, for any given level of other fundamentals.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investing in financial service companies has historically been viewed as
 a conservative strategy for investors who wanted high dividends and preferred
 price stability.
 Investing in these firms today requires a more nuanced strategy that goes
 beyond looking at the dividend yield and current earnings, and looks at
 potential risk in these firms by examining the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Capitalization buffer: most financial service firms are governed by regulatory
 requirements on capital.
 Look for firms that not only met but also beat regulatory capital requirements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Operating risk: risk can vary widely across financial service firms within
 a sector (banks, insurance companies).
 Seek out firms that are operating in average risk or below average risk
 businesses, while generating healthy earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transparency: transparency in reporting allows investors to make better
 assessments of value, and the failure to be transparent may be a deliberate
 attempt to hide risk.
 Search for firms that provide details about their operations and the risks
 that they may be exposed to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Significant restrictions on new entrants into the business: high returns
 on equity are a key factor determining value.
 Look for firms that operate in profitable businesses with significant barriers
 to new entrants.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In summary, invest in financial service firms that not only deliver high
 dividends, but also generate high returns on equity from relatively safe
 investments.
 Avoid financial service firms that overreach - investing in riskier, higher
 growth businesses - without setting aside sufficient regulatory capital
 buffers.

If oil prices are expected to surge, how much will Exxon Mobil's stock price

 Even mature cyclical and commodity companies have volatile earnings and
 cash flows, making investing in them akin to riding a roller coaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cyclical commodities are drawn from sectors such as housing and automobiles.
 They include cyclical companies with earnings that track overall economic
 growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Commodity companies derive their earnings from producing commodities that
 may become inputs to other companies in the economy (oil, iron ore) or
 be desired as investments in their own right (gold, platinum, diamonds).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both types of companies share some common characteristics that can affect
 how they are valued:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The economic/commodity price cycle: cyclical companies are at the mercy
 of the economic cycle.
 The odds are high that most cyclical companies will see revenues decrease
 in the face of a significant economic downturn and rise when the economy
 recovers.
 Commodity companies are, for the most part, price takers.
 When commodity prices are on an upswing, all companies that produce that
 commodity benefit, whereas during a downturn, even the best companies in
 the business will see earnings decline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finite resources: with commodity companies, there is another shared characterist
ic.
 There is a finite quantity of natural resources on the planet.
 When valuing commodity companies, this will not only play a role in what
 our forecasts of future commodity prices will be but may also operate as
 a constraint on our normal practice of assuming perpetual growth (in our
 terminal value computations).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When valuing commodity and cyclical companies, we have to grapple with the
 consequences of economic and commodity price cycles and how shifts in these
 cycles will affect revenues and earnings.
 We also have to come up with ways of dealing with the possibility of distress,
 induced not by bad management decisions or firm specific choices, but by
 macroeconomic forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Valuation Issues
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The inputs for these companies are heavily affected by macro economic variables
 - the price of the commodity in the case of commodity companies and the
 state of the economy for cyclical firms.
 As commodity prices and economic growth rates change, operating income
 will change by more, because of the high fixed costs at these firms.
 Thus, commodity companies may have to keep mines (mining), reserves (oil),
 and fields (agricultural) operating even during low points in price cycles,
 because the costs of shutting down and reopening operations can be prohibitive.
 This volatility in earnings will feed into both equity and debt values
 (thus affecting cost of capital) and potentially put even the healthiest
 firms at risk of distress and default, if the macro economic move is very
 negative.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The same factors will also play out in relative valuations.
 Multiples of earnings will swing widely for cyclical and commodity companies.
 While growth potential can vary across companies, growth rates can also
 change dramatically across the cycle.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Valuation solutions
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The easiest way to value these is to look past the year-to-year swings in
 earnings and cash flows and to look for smoothed out number underneath.
 There are usually 3 standard techniques that are employed for normalizing
 earnings and cash flows of cyclical companies:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Absolute average over time: average earnings over time.
 The average should occur over a period long enough to cover an entire cycle;
 the typical economic cycle in the US lasts 5-10 years.
 This is a simple approach, but using an absolute value will yield too low
 a number for a growing company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Relative average over time: a simple solution to the scaling problem is
 to compute averages for a scaled version of the variable over time.
 You can average profit margins over time, instead of actual profits, and
 apply the average profit margin to revenues in the most recent period to
 estimate normalized earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sector averages: for firms with limited or unreliable history, it may make
 more sense to look at sector averages in order to normalize.
 Thus, you can compute operating margins for all steel companies across
 the cycle and use the average margin to estimate operating income for an
 individual steel company.
 Sector margins tend to be less volatile than individual company margins,
 but this approach will also fail to incorporate the characteristics that
 may lead a firm to be different from the rest of the sector.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
With commodity companies, the variable that causes the volatility is the
 price of the commodity.
 Consequently, normalization with commodity companies has to be built around
 a normalized commodity price.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What is a normalized price for oil or gold? There are two ways of answering
 this question.
 One is to look at the average price of the commodity over time, adjusted
 for inflation.
 The other is to determine a fair price for the commodity, given the demand
 and supply for that commodity.
 Once you have normalized the price of the commodity, you can assess what
 the revenues, earnings, and cash flows would have been for the company
 being valued at that normalized price.
 With revenues and earnings, this may just require multiplying the number
 of units sold at the normalized price and making reasonable assumptions
 about costs.
 With reinvestment and cost of financing, it will require some subjective
 judgments on how much (if any) the reinvestment and cost of funding numbers
 would have changed at the normalized price.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Note: since most commodities have forward and futures markets, you can use
 the prices for these markets to estimate cash flows in the next few years.
 The advantage of this approach is that it comes with a built-in mechanism
 for hedging against commodity price risk.
 An investor who believes that a company is undervalued but is shaky on
 what will happen to commodity prices in the future can buy stock in the
 company and sell oil price futures to protect against adverse price movements.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
One critique of conventional valuation approaches is that they fail to consider
 adequately the interrelationship between the commodity price and the investment
 and financing actions of commodity companies.
 In other words, oil companies produce more oil and have more cash to return
 to stockholders when oil prices are high than they do when oil prices are
 low.
 Thus, these firms have options to develop their oil reserves, which they
 can exercise after observing the oil price, and these options can add to
 value.
 Even if you never explicitly use option-pricing models to value natural
 resource reserves or firms, there are implications for value.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Price volatility affects value: the value of a commodity company is a function
 of not only the price of the commodity but also the expected volatility
 in that price.
 The price matters for obvious reasons - higher commodity prices translate
 into higher revenues, earnings, and cash flows.
 More volatile commodity prices can make undeveloped reserves more valuable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mature versus growth commodity companies: as commodity prices become more
 volatile, commodity companies that derive more of their value from undeveloped
 reserves will gain in value, relative to more mature companies that generate
 cash flows from developed reserves.
 If the oil price volatility is perceived to have increased even though
 the price itself has not changed, you would expect one oil company to gain
 in value relative to another oil company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Development of reserves: as commodity price volatility increases, commodity
 companies will become more reluctant to develop their reserves, holding
 out for even higher prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optionality increases as commodity price decreases: the option value of
 reserves is greatest when commodity prices are low (and the reserves are
 either marginally viable or not viable) and should decrease as commodity
 prices increase.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you regard undeveloped reserves as options, discounted cash flow valuation
 will generally underestimate the value of natural resource companies, because
 the expected price of the commodity is used to estimate revenues and operating
 profits.
 Again, the difference will be greatest for firms with significant undeveloped
 reserves and with commodities where price volatility is highest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When investing in a commodity company, you are also investing in the underlying
 commodity.
 There are two ways you can incorporate this reality into your investing
 strategy.
 In the first, you take a stand on commodity prices and invest in companies
 that will benefit the most from your forecasted price move.
 Thus, if commodity prices are low, and you believe that they will increase
 significantly in the future, the value payoff will be highest in companies
 with significant undeveloped reserves of the commodity and the funding
 to survive near-term adverse price movements.
 In the second, you can accept that you are not a good prognosticator of
 commodity prices, and focus on picking the best companies in the sector.
 Look for companies that have significant low-cost reserves and are efficient
 in finding and exploiting new reserves.
 To protect yourself against commodity futures and options to at least partially
 hedge your investment in the company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are also two analogous investment strategies you can adopt with cyclical
 companies.
 The first is to put your faith in your forecasts of overall economic growth.
 If you believe that overall economic growth will be stronger than the rest
 of the market thinks it will be, you should buy strong cyclical companies
 that will benefit from the economic upswing.
 This strategy is most likely to work in periods of economic malaise, where
 investors are overreacting to current economic indicators and selling cyclical
 stocks.
 The second is a more standard valuation strategy, where you own up to your
 inability to forecast economic cycles and focus on buying the best bargains
 in each cyclical sector.
 In particular, you want to find companies that trade at the same multiple
 of normalized earnings as the rest of the companies in the sector, while
 generating higher profit margins and returns on capital on a normalized
 basis.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The accounting for intangible assets is not consistent with its treatment
 of physical assets.
 Accounting first principles suggest a simple rule to separate capital expenses
 from operating expenses.
 Any expense that creates benefits over many years is a capital expense,
 whereas expenses that generate benefits only in the current year are operating
 expenses.
 Accountants stay true to this distinction with manufacturing firms, putting
 investments in plant, equipment, and building in the capital expense column,
 and labor and raw material expenses in the operating expense column.
 However, they seem to ignore these first principles when it comes to firms
 with intangible assets.
 The most significant capital expenditures made by technology and pharmaceutical
 firms is in R&D, by consumer product companies in brand name advertising,
 and by consulting firms in training and recruiting personnel.
 Using the argument that the benefits are too uncertain, accountants have
 treated these expenses as operating expenses.
 As a consequence, earnings and capital expenditures tend to be understated
 at these firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These firms are much more using options to compensate management than firms
 in other businesses.
 Some of this behavior can be attributed to where these firms are in the
 life cycle (closer to growth than mature), but some of it has to be related
 to how dependent these firms are on retaining human capital.

Valuation Issues
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The miscategorization of capital expenses, the sparing use of debt and the
 dependence on equity-based compensation (options and restricted stock),
 can create problems when we value these firms.
 Put more bluntly, the accounting measures of book value, earnings, and
 capital expenditures for firms with intangible assets are all misleading,
 insofar as they do not measure what they claim to measure and because they
 are not directly comparable to the same items at a manufacturing firm.
 To value companies with intangible assets, we have to begin by correcting
 the erroneous accounting classification of capital expenses, and restate
 the fundamental inputs into value - operating income, capital expenditure,
 and return on capital.
 Once we make those corrections, these companies look very much like the
 companies in other sectors and can be valued using the same metrics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The same problems play out in relative valuation.
 The PE ratio for a technology company is not directly comparable to the
 PE ratio for a manufacturing firm, since earnings are not measured consistently
 across firms.
 Even within technology firms, it is not clear that a company that trades
 at a lower multiple of earnings or book value is cheaper than one that
 trades at a higher multiples.
 The accounting inconsistencies that skew earnings and book value measures
 in intrinsic valuation models also make it difficult to make comparisons
 of multiples based upon these values.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Clean up the income statement and balance sheet, and re-categorize operating
 and capital expenses.
 The intent is not just to get a better measure of earnings, though that
 is a side benefit, but also to get a clearer sense of what the firm is
 investing to generate future growth.
 Second, we also have to deal more effectively with management options -
 the ones that have been granted in the past as well the ones that we expect
 to be granted in the future.

Regaining Accounting Consistency
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Using the rationale that the products of research are too uncertain and
 difficult to quantify, accounting standards have generally required that
 all R&D expenditure be shown as an operating expense in the period in which
 it occurs.
 This has several consequences, but one of the most profound is that the
 value of the assets created by research does not show up on the balance
 sheet as part of the total assets of the firm.
 This, in turn, creates ripple effects for the measurement of capital and
 profitability ratios for the firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Research expenses, notwithstanding the uncertainty about future benefits,
 should be capitalized.
 To capitalize and value research assets, we have to make an assumption
 about how long it takes for research and development to be converted, on
 average, into commercial products.
 This is called the amortizable life of these assets.
 This life will vary across firms and reflect the commercial life of the
 products that emerge from the research.
 It can be, for example for biotechnology company, 10 years, as it is the
 approval process for new drugs.
 For simplicity, it can be assumed that the amortization is uniform over
 time, and in the case of the research asset with a 10-year life, you assume
 that one-tenth of the expense is written off each year to get the cumulated
 amortization expense for the current year (sum of all cumulations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once the amortizable life of R&D expenses has been estimated, the next step
 is to collect data on R&D expenses over past years ranging back to the
 amortizable life of the research asset.
 You have to add up the unamortized portion of the expenses from prior years,
 yielding the capital invested in the research assets.
 This augments the value of the assets of the firm, and by extension, the
 book value of equity (and capital):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
adjusted book value of equity = stated book value of equity + capital invested
 in R&D
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The reported accounting income is adjusted to reflect the capitalization
 of R&D expenses.
 First, the R&D expenses that were subtracted out to arrive at the operating
 income are added back to the operating income, reflecting their re-categorizati
on as capital expenses.
 Next, the amortization of the research asset is treated like depreciation
 and netted out to arrive at the adjusted operating income and adjusted
 net income:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
adjusted operating income = stated operating income + R&D expenses - R&D
 amortization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
adjusted net income = net income + R&D expenses - R&D amortization
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The adjusted operating income will generally increase for firms that have
 R&D expenses that are growing over time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While R&D expenses are the most prominent example of capital expenses being
 treated as operating expenses, there are other operating expenses that
 arguably should be treated as capital expenses.
 Consumer product companies such as KO could make a case that a portion
 of advertising expenses should be treated as capital expenses, since they
 are designed to augment brand name value.
 For a consulting firm like KPMG, the cost of recruiting and training its
 employees could be considered a capital expense, since the consultants
 who emerge are likely to be the heart of the firm's value and provide benefits
 over many years.
 For many new technology firms, including online retailers such as Amazon,
 the biggest operating expense item is selling, general and administrative
 expenses (SG&A).
 These firms could argue that a portion of these expenses should be treated
 as capital expenses since they are designed to increase brand name awareness
 and bring in new, presumably long term, customers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While these arguments have some merit, we remain wary about using them to
 justify capitalizing these expenses.
 For an operating expense to be capitalized there should be substantial
 evidence that the benefits from the expense accrue over multiple periods.
 Does a customer who is enticed to buy from Amazon, based upon an advertisement
 or promotion, continue as a customer for the long term? There are some
 analysts who claim that this is indeed the case and attribute significant
 value added to each new customer.
 It would be logical, under those circumstances, to capitalize these expenses
 using a procedure similar to that used to capitalize R&D expenses:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Determine the period over which the benefits from the operating expense
 (such as SG&A) will flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimate the value of the asset (similar to the research asset) creased
 by these expenses.
 This amount will be added to the book value of equity/capital and used
 to estimate the returns on equity and capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adjust the operating income for the expense and the amortization of the
 created asset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The net effects of the capitalization will be seen most visibly in the reinvestm
ent rates and returns on capital you estimate for these firms.

Intrinsic Valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you capitalize the expenses associated with creating intangible assets,
 you are in effect redoing the financial statements of the firm and restating
 numbers that are fundamental inputs into valuation - earnings, reinvestment,
 and measures of returns.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Earnings: adding back the current year's expense and subtracting out the
 amortization of past expenses, the effect on earnings will generally be
 positive if expenses have risen over time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reinvestment: the effect on reinvestment is identical to the effect on earnings,
 with reinvestment increasing or decreasing by exactly the same amount as
 earnings.
 That will generally increase the reinvestment rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Capital invested: since the unamortized portion of the prior year's expenses
 is treated as an asset, it adds to the estimated equity or capital invested
 in the firm.
 The effect will increase with the amortizable life and should therefore
 be higher for pharmaceutical firms (where amortizable lives tend to be
 longer) than for software firms (where research pays off far more quickly
 as commercial products).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Return on equity (capital): since both earnings and capital invested are
 affected by capitalization, the net effects on return on equity and capital
 are unpredictable.
 If the return on equity (capital) increases after the recapitalization,
 it can be considered a rough indicator that the returns earned by the firm
 on its R&D is greater than its returns on traditional investments.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In addition to providing us with more realistic estimates of what these
 firms are investing in their growth and the quality of their investments,
 the capitalization process also restores consistency to valuations by ensuring
 that growth rates are in line with reinvestment and return on capital assumptio
ns.
 Thus, technology or pharmaceutical firms that want to continue to grow
 have to keep investing in R&D, while ensuring that these investments, at
 least collectively, generate high returns for the firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series bold
Relative Valuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is true that all technology and pharmaceutical companies operate under
 the same flawed accounting rules, expensing R&D rather than capitalizing
 it.
 That does not mean, though, that there are no consequences for relative
 valuation.
 The effect of capitalizing R&D on earnings and book value can vary widely
 across firms and will depend upon the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Age of the firm and stage in life cycle: generally speaking, the proportional
 effects of capitalization on earnings and book value will be much greater
 at young growth firms than at more mature firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Amortizable life: the effect of capitalizing expenses will be much greater
 as we extend the amortizable life of R&D, especially on capital invested.
 If different firms within the same business convert research into commercial
 products at different speeds, the effect on earnings of capitalizing R&D
 can vary across firms.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you ignore accounting inconsistencies and use the reported earnings and
 book values of firms in the computation of multiples, younger firms or
 firms that have R&D with longer gestation periods will look overvalued
 (even if they are fairly priced or bargains).
 Their earnings and book value will be understated, leading to much higher
 PE, EV/EBITDA, and book value multiples for these firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two ways to incorporate these factors into relative valuation.
 The first is to capitalize the expenses associated with investing in intangible
 assets for each firm and to compute consistent measures of earnings and
 book value to use in multiples.
 This approach, while yielding the most precision, is also the most time
 and data intensive.
 The second is to stick with the reported accounting values for earnings
 and book value, while controlling for the factors listed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can compute PE ratio in conventional way - dividing the market capitalizatio
n by the net income; or using the sum of net income and R&D; or by netting
 out amortization of R&D: net income + R&D expense - amortization of R&D.
 This last measure, with both R&D and its amortization incorporated yields
 the fairest comparison.

Dealing with Equity options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms that pay managers and others with equity options are giving away some
 of the stockholders' equity to these people.
 To deal with the resulting loss in value to common stockholders, there
 are three approaches that are employed in intrinsic valuation:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Assume that all or some of the options will be exercised in the future,
 adjust the number of shares outstanding and divide the value of equity
 by this number to arrive at value per share; this is the diluted shares
 approach.
 To estimate the value of equity per share, divide the aggregate value of
 equity estimated by the total number of shares outstanding, including options:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
aggregate value of equity / (# of shares outstanding + # of options)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Incorporate the exercise proceeds from the options in the numerator and
 then divide by the number of shares that would be outstanding after exercise;
 this is the treasury stock approach:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
(value of equity + options outstanding * average exercise price) / (# of
 shares outstanding + # of options)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Estimate the value of the options today, given today's value per share and
 the time premium on the option.
 Once this value has been estimated, it is subtracted from the estimated
 equity value, and the remaining amount is divided by the number of shares
 outstanding to arrive at value per share.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
(value of equity - value of options) / primary shares outstanding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
value of options - you have to find out the average maturity (in years)
 and exercise price
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When choosing which approach to take, consider that the first is the crudest,
 the second is slightly more tempered, and the third is the most work, but
 it is the right way to deal with options.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Comparing multiples across companies is complicated by the fact that firms
 often have varying numbers of employee options outstanding and these options
 can have very different values.
 A failure to explicitly factor these options into analysis will result
 in companies with unusually large or small (relative to the peer group)
 numbers of options outstanding looking misvalued on a relative basis.
 With PE ratios, for instance, using primary earnings per share will make
 companies with more options outstanding look cheap.
 Using fully diluted earnings per share will make firms that have long-term,
 deep in-the-money options outstanding look cheap.
 The only way to incorporate the effect of options into earnings multiples
 is to value the options at fair value, using the current stock price as
 the basis, and add this value on to the market capitalization to arrive
 at the total market value of equity.
\end_layout

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The biggest hurdle when investing in firms with intangible assets is that
 the accounting numbers, at least as stated, are deceptive.
 As an investor, you have to correct for those accounting problems and focus
 on companies that have the following characteristics:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Intangible assets that generate high returns: for intangible assets to generate
 value, they have to earn high returns.
 Look for a firm with intangible assets that are unique and difficult to
 replicate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reasonable prices for "true" earnings: many firms with intangible assets
 have high growth potential and are priced to reflect that growth.
 Using the mismatch test, invest in companies that have high growth in earnings,
 corrected for accounting miscategorization, and that trade at low multiples
 of these corrected earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Spending to preserve and augment these intangible assets: intangible assets
 do not always stay valuable, especially if they are ignored.
 Focus on firms that invest in these assets (by spending on R&D, recruiting,
 or advertising) to preserve and grow value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Spending is efficient: not all expenditures on intangible assets generate
 value.
 Keep tabs on investments in intangible assets to see how quickly and how
 well they pay off and steer your money towards firms that rank highly on
 both dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equity claims drain per share value: firms with intangible assets tend to
 be big users of equity options as compensation, which can affect equity
 value per share.
 Incorporate the effects of outstanding options into your estimates of value
 per share and avoid companies that are cavalier about issuing new options
 to managers.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In effect, you want to invest in companies that make investments in intangible
 assets and are able to leverage these assets to generate high returns,
 while protecting your share of equity ownership.
