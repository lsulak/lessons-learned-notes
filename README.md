# lessons-learned-notes
My personal notes about various things I learnt (and I'm continuously
learning). 

There are two groups of notes:

1) LyX books: Software and data engineering, math and machine learning, and
   some other things related to IT and beyond, including investing -
   especially into stocks and real estate.

2) Sheet Cheats: A collection of very useful cheat sheets (usually as PDFs
   or images) gathered from various places on the Internet.
