# lessons-learned-notes
My personal notes about various things I learnt (and I'm continuously
learning).

There are two groups of notes: LyX notes and sheet cheats.

Disclaimer(s):
* You should not rely on this material as a basis for making any business,
  legal or any other decisions. I realize that not everything written in these
  notes is absolutely true under all circumstances. These are just my personal
  notes, and they are not always up-to date, nor they reflect my full, and
  the most up-to date knowledge. This is really just my brain dump I decided
  to share publicly.
* I read many books and articles, finished a lot of online courses, listened
  to many podcasts and watched thousands of YouTube videos, and there are
  even some notes from my university studies. I tried to always provide
  the original resource of the information (at least into the final chapter
  with the list of resources) - but I realize that the list of citations
  and resources is by no means full and complete. Some notes were written in
  a rush and there might be significant grammar errors and typos.
* Most of the notes are in English language, but some of them are (or contain)
  segments written in Slovak language.

1) LyX books: Software and data engineering, math and machine learning, and
   some other things related to IT and beyond, including investing -
   especially into stocks and real estate.

2) Sheet Cheats: A collection of very useful cheat sheets (usually as PDFs
   or images) gathered from various places on the Internet.
