# lessons-learned-notes

My personal notes about various things I learned, and I'm continuously
learning.

Topics: software and data engineering, math and machine learning, and some
other things related to IT and beyond, including investing - especially stocks
and real estate investing.

## Notes Collection

There are two groups of notes in this repository: LyX notes and sheet cheats.

### 1. LyX books

I was writing notes over the years - I finally decided to give it a structure
and a proper format, versioning support, and the final shape available on any
platform. Collection of LyX notes is compiled into a collection of PDFs, which
is stored on AWS, which is publicly available to anyone.

## Disclaimer(s)

* You should not rely on this material as a basis for making any business,
  legal or any other decisions. I realize that not everything written in these
  notes is absolutely true under all circumstances. These are just my personal
  notes, and they are not always up-to date, nor they reflect my full, and
  the most up-to date knowledge. This is really just my brain dump I decided
  to share publicly.
* I read many books and articles, finished a lot of online courses, listened
  to many podcasts and watched thousands of YouTube videos, and there are
  even some notes from my university studies. I tried to always provide
  the original resource of the information (at least into the final chapter
  with the list of resources) - but I realize that the list of citations
  and resources is by no means full and complete. Some notes were written in
  a rush and there might be significant grammar errors and typos.
* Most of the notes are in English language, but some of them are (or contain)
  segments written in Slovak language.
* Some notes are still in progress.
