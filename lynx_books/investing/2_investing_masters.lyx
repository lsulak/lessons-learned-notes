 the most famous investors.
 However, we didn't include all of the ideas here - rather, we kept the
 most significant points and strategies here, and we decided to keep some
 minor thoughts in many other chapters across this book, especially in chapters

\begin_layout Subsection
Benjamin Graham
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He insisted on paying a fair price for a stock no matter how bright its
 prospects were.
 That's a value approach to investing.
 However, he recognized the importance of a company's ability to grow earnings.
 This combination of value and growth is the foundation of good investing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nobody ever knows what the market will do, but we can profit by reacting
 intelligently to what it does do.
 It's a voting machine in the short term (reflecting a voter-registration
 test that requires only money, not intelligence or emotional stability),
 but a weighing machine in the long term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because we are all members of the general public and the public is usually
 wrong, we should rely on hard measurements to counteract our emotions and
 give ourselves something to feel secure about
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stocks have business valuations and market valuations.
 The first is what the company would be worth if it was liquidated, the
 second is the price the market has placed on the stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We should know a stock's margin of safety, which is a general feel for how
 much that stock can drop in price and still be a good investment.
 Central to determining a stock's margin of safety is knowing the difference
 between its business valuation and market valuation.
 Graham was deliberately vague in describing a stock's margin of safety.
 He said that investment analysis is not an exact science.
 There are hard factors like book value financial statements, and debt,
 but there are subjective factors like quality of management and nature
 of the business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long-term debt is very bad because it reduces the company's business valuation.
 The bills need to be paid even when brilliant managers make mistakes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investors should buy a stock that has Price/Book ratio < 0.66.
 And even at that low price, Graham wanted to see a low P/E ratio, which
 usually accompanies a low price/book ratio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Philip Fisher
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Warren Buffett was so impressed with his book Common Stocks and Uncommon
 Profits, that he met him personally.
 In 1969, Buffett told Forbes that "I'm 15 percent Fisher and 85 percent
 Benjamin Graham."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A company's profit margin coupled with its ability to maintain and improve
 them will tell you everything you need to know about its earning power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Invest in companies with the power to earn a profit and outpace their competitio
n.
 That's a growth approach to investing.
 To find superior companies, Fisher was willing to look beyond hard numbers
 to factors that are not measurable, such as capabilities of management
 and the perception of those who know the company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buy businesses with the ability to grow sales and profits over the years
 at rates greater than their industry average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Look for capable management.
 The best management is willing to sacrifice immediate profits for long-term
 gains and maintains integrity and honesty with shareholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sales are key to everything.
 Profits must follow sales.
 Sales are irrelevant if they don't produce profit.
 You should know a company's profit margins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Profits must be realized soon enough to be useful.
 You should look for positive cash flow and a healthy cash reserve so the
 company can meet obligations without borrowing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lowest-cost producers have an edge in all phases of the economy.
 Combined with a high profit margin, low-cost production is Fisher's version
 of Graham's margin of safety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Circle of competence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because of the extensive research needed to uncover superior companies,
 you should own just a handful at any given time.
 A few superior companies beats a slew of mediocre ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What to buy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How Philip Fisher used to find a growth stock:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ask relatives, scientists, financial groups, invest mentors, and so on.
 Few hours' conversation with an outstanding investment man usually, occasionall
y with a business executive or scientist.
 Then, if a company might be exciting, he will start with the investigation
 - step 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Here, he didn't approach management nor spend hours and hours going over
 old annual reports and making minute studies of minor year-by-year changes
 in the balance sheet.
 He didn't ask every stockbroker he knew what they think of the stock.
 However, he used to glance over the balance sheet to determine the general
 nature of the capitalization and financial position.
 If there is an SEC prospectus, he read with care those parts covering breakdown
 of total sales by product lines, competition, degree of officer or other
 major ownership of common stock, all earning statement figures throwing
 light on depreciation, profit margins, extent of research activity, and
 abnormal or non-recurring costs in prior years' operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then, if he still liked a company, he used his "scuttlebutt" method.
 He tries to contact every key customer, supplier, competitor, ex-employee,
 or scientist in a related field that he knew or whom he could approach
 through mutual friends.
 If he couldn't find a good amount of information, he gave up and move on
 to something else.
 All 15 points described above must be passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then, if all is good (this can be 3 companies out of 250), he approached
 management - but he was fully prepared for that.
 It's good to already know the weaknesses of a given business prior to the
 meeting.
 Fisher believed that you should visit the management with having at least
 50% of all the knowledge you need to make the investment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philip Fisher compiled a list of criteria he considered to be very important:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[Expanding market]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have a products/services with sufficient market potential to
 make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Companies with stagnating or declining sales - for bargain hunters or speculator
s, but it's not for investors seeking the greatest possible gains.
 Also be aware of situation in which there is a large increase in sales
 for a period of very few years, after which sales stop growing.
 In the second case, an investor can make profit by buying early enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Not even the most outstanding growth companies need necessarily be expected
 to show sales for every single year larger than those of the year before.
 Sales growth should not be judged on an annual basis, but, say, by taking
 units of several years each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Correctly judging the long-range sales curve of a company is of extreme
 importance to the investor.
 Superficial judgment can lead to wrong conclusions.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Develop New Products]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Management must have a determination to continue to develop products or
 processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when
 the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have largely
 been exploited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Companies which have a significant growth prospect for the next few years
 because of new demand for existing lines, but which have neither policies
 nor plans to provide for further developments beyond this may provide a
 vehicle for a nice one-time profit.
 They are not apt to provide the means for the consistent gains over ten
 or 25 years that are the surest route to financial success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The investor usually obtains the best results in companies whose engineering
 or research is to a considerable extent devoted to products having some
 business relationship to those already within the scope of company activities.
 This doesn't mean that a desirable company may not have a number of divisions,
 some of which have product lines quite different from others.
 It does mean that a company with research centered around each of these
 divisions will usually do much better than a company working on a number
 of unrelated new products which, if successful, will land it in several
 new industries unrelated to its existing business.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Efficient R&D]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How effective are the company's research and development efforts in relation
 to its size?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Just looking at numbers about how much money companies spend for R&D can
 be misleading, unless a great deal of further knowledge is obtained.
 Companies vary enormously in what they include or exclude as R&D expense.
 Also, does the management really understands the nature of the research?
 What about the coordination of such an activity between the top-level managemen
t and researchers or managers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A worthwhile method is to make a close study of how much in dollar sales
 or net profits has been contributed to a company by the results of its
 research organization during a particular span such as the prior 10 years.
 An organization which in relation to the size of this activities has produced
 a good flow of profitable new products during such a period will probably
 be equally productive in the future as long as it continues to operate
 under the same general methods.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Sales]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have an above-average sales organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Without sales, survival is impossible.
 It is the making of repeat sales to satisfied customers that is the first
 benchmark of success.
 Check relative efficiency of a company's sales, advertising, and distributive
 organizations.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Profit Margin]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have a worthwhile profit margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sales are only of value when and if they lead to increased profits.
 The first step in examining profits is to study a company's profit margin,
 that is, to determine the number of cents of each dollar of sales that
 is brought down to operating profit.
 Such a study should be made for a series of years not for a single year.
 It then becomes evident that nearly all companies have broader profit margins
 (and also greater total dollar profits) in years when an industry is unusually
 prosperous.
 However, it also becomes clear that the marginal companies (ones with the
 smaller profit margins) nearly always increase their profit margins by
 a considerably greater % in the good years than do the lower-cost companies,
 whose profit margins also get better but not to so great a degree.
 This usually causes the weaker companies to show a greater % increase in
 earnings in a year of abnormally good business than do the stronger companies
 in the same field.
 However, it should also be remembered that these earnings will decline
 correspondingly more rapidly when the business tide turns.
 For this reason Fisher believes that the greatest long-range investment
 profits are never obtained by investing in marginal companies.
 The only reason for considering a long-range investment in a company with
 an abnormally low profit margin is that there might be strong indications
 that a fundamental change is taking place within the company.
 When such internal changes are taking place in a corporation which in other
 respects pretty well qualifies as the right type of long-range investment,
 it may by an unusually attractive purchase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So far as older and larger companies are concerned, most of the really big
 investment gains have come from companies having relatively broad profit
 margins.
 Usually they have among the best such margins in their industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In regard to young companies, and occasionally older ones, there is an important
 deviation from this rule - such companies will at times deliberately elect
 to speed up growth by sending all or a very large part of the profits they
 would otherwise have earned on even more research or on even more sales
 promotion than they would otherwise have earned on even more research or
 even more sales promotion than they would otherwise be doing.
 It's important to make sure in such instances that it is actually still
 further research, sales promotion, or still more of any other activity
 which is being financed today so as to build for the future, that is the
 real cause of the narrow or non-existent profit margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When low margin is cause d by activities needed for the growth, such as
 research sales promotion etc, a company with apparently poor profit margin
 may by an unusually attractive investment.
 However, with the exception of companies of this type in which the low
 profit margin is being deliberately engineered in order to further accelerate
 the growth rate, investors desiring maximum gains over the years had best
 stay away from low-profit-margin or marginal companies.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Future Profit Margin] 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must maintain or improve profit margins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The success of a stock purchase does not depend on what is generally known
 about a company at the time the purchase is made.
 Rather it depends upon what gets to be known about it after the stock has
 been purchased.
 Therefore it is not the profit margins of the past but those of the future
 that are basically important to the investor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some companies are in seemingly fortunate position that they can maintain
 profit margins simply by raising prices.
 This is usually because they are in industries in which the demand for
 their products is abnormally strong or because the selling prices of competitiv
e products have gone up even more than their own.
 But maintaining profit margins in this way usually proves a relatively
 temporary matter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some companies achieve great success by maintaining capital-improvement
 or product-engineering departments.
 The sole function of such departments is to design new equipment that will
 reduce costs and thus offset or partially offset the rising trend of wares.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
None of these things can be brought about in a day.
 They all require close study and considerable planning ahead.
 The prospective investor should give attention to the amount of ingenuity
 of the work being done on new ideas for cutting costs and improving profit
 margins.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Great Labor Relations] 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have outstanding labor and personnel relations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The effect of production of frequent and prolonged strikes is obvious to
 anyone making even the most cursory review of corporate financial statements.
 The difference in the degree of profitability between a company with good
 personnel relations and one with mediocre personnel relations is far greater
 than the direct cost of strikes.
 It's about increasing productivity per worker when the workers are fairly
 treated by their employer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unionization is by no means a sign of poor labor relations.
 Record of constant and prolonged strikes is a good indication of bad labor
 relations, the complete absence of strikes is not necessarily a sign of
 fundamentally good relations.
 Sometimes the company with no strikes is too much like the henpecked husband.
 Absence of conflict may not mean a basically happy relationship so much
 as fear of the consequences of conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Companies with good labor relations usually are ones making every effort
 to settle grievances quickly.
 The small individual grievances that take long to settle and are not considered
 important by management are ones that smolder and finally flare up seriously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If management doesn't feel a responsibility to make ordinary employees feel
 they are wanted, needed, and part of the business picture, and if nothing
 is done to build up the dignity of the individual worker, management with
 this attitude do not usually provide the background for the most desirable
 type of investment.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Executive Relations]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have outstanding executive relations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There must be a good executive climate.
 Promotions are based on ability, not factionalism.
 Salary adjustments are reviewed regularly so that executives feel that
 merited increases will come without having to be demanded.
 Salaries are at least in line with the standard of the industry and the
 locality.
 The further a corporation departs from these standards, the less likely
 it is to be a really outstanding investment.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Management] 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have depth to its management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All humans are finite, so even for smaller companies the investor should
 have some idea of what can be done to prevent corporate disaster if the
 key man should no longer be available.
 Sooner or later a company will reach a size where it just will not be able
 to take advantage of further opportunities unless it starts developing
 executive talent in some depth.
 This point will vary between companies, depending on the industry in which
 they are engaged and the skill of the one-man management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Delegation of authority - from very top on down, each level of executives
 must be given real authority to carry out assigned duties in as ingenious
 and efficient way as possible.
 Capable people must be developed to handle the still further growth that
 will lie ahead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, top management must welcome and evaluate suggestions from personnel
 even if, at times, those suggestions carry with them adverse criticism
 of current management practices.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Cost Analysis]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No company is going to continue to have outstanding success for a long period
 of time if it cannot break down its overall costs with sufficient accuracy
 and detail to show the cost of each small step in its operation.
 Only in this way will a management know what most needs its attention.
 Only in this way can management judge whether it is properly solving each
 problem that does need its attention.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Great Industry Specifics] 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Are there other aspects of the business somewhat peculiar to the industry
 involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding
 the company may be in relation to its competition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Matters of this sort are bound to differ considerably from each other -
 those which are of great importance in some lines of business can, at times,
 be of little or no importance in others.
 Here can belong patterns, technical know-how and skill, knowledge of customer
 problems, sales and service organization, customer goodwill, and many more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As has been true many times before and since, it is the constant leadership
 in engineering, not patents, that is the fundamental source of protection.
 The investor must be at least as careful not to place too much importance
 on patent protection as to recognize its significance in those occasional
 places where it is a major factor in appraising the attractiveness of a
 desirable investment.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Long-range On Profits]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Company must have short-range or long-range outlook in regard to profits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some companies will conduct their affairs so as to gain the greatest possible
 profit right now.
 Others will deliberately curtail maximum immediate profits to build up
 good will and thereby gain greater overall profits over a period of years.
 Treatment of customers and vendors gives frequent examples of this.
 One company will constantly make the sharpest possible deals with suppliers.
 Another will at times pay above contract price to a vendor who has had
 unexpected expense in making delivery, because it wants to be sure of having
 a dependable source of needed raw materials or high-quality components
 available when the market has turned and supplies may be desperately needed.
 The difference in treatment of customers is equally noticeable.
 The company that will go to special trouble and expense to take care of
 the needs of a regular customer caught in an unexpected jam may show lower
 profits on the particular transaction, but far greater profits over the
 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The investor wanting maximum results should favor companies with a truly
 long-range outlook concerning profits.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[Low Risk for Dilution]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company require sufficient
 equity financing so that the larger number of shares then outstanding will
 largely cancel the existing stockholders' benefit from this anticipated
 growth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The intelligent investor should not buy common stocks simply because they
 are cheap but only if they give promise of major gain to him.
 It's not just about corporation's cash position, corporate structure, percentag
e of capitalization in various classes of securities etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What really matters is whether the company's cash plus further borrowing
 ability is sufficient to take care of the capital needed to exploit the
 prospects of the next several years.
 If it is, and if the company is willing to borrow to the limit of prudence,
 the common stock investor need have no concern as to the more distant future.
 Near term financing will have produced enough increase in earnings, by
 the time still further financing is needed some years hence, to have brought
 the stock to a substantially higher price level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If this borrowing power is not now sufficient, however, equity financing
 becomes necessary.
 In this case, the attractiveness of the investment depends on careful calculati
ons as to how much the dilution resulting from the greater number of shares
 to be outstanding will cut into the benefits to the present common stockholder
 that will result from the increased earnings this financing makes possible.
 It is well to consider that all senior convertible issues have been converted
 and that all warrants, options, etc., have been exercised when calculating
 the real number of common shares outstanding.
\end_layout

If equity financing will be occurring within several years of the time of
 common stock purchase, and if this equity financing will leave common stockhold
ers with only a small increase in subsequent per-share earnings, only one
 conclusion is justifiable.
 This is that the company has a management with sufficiently poor financial
 judgment to make the common stock undesirable for worthwhile investment.
 Unless this situation prevails, the investor need not be deterred by purely
 financial considerations from going into any situation which, because of
 its high rating on the remaining 14 points covered, gives promise of being
 outstanding.
 Conversely, from the standpoint of making maximum profits over the years,
 the investor should never go into a situation with a poor score on any
 of the other 14 points, merely because of great financial strength or cash

It is the nature of business that in even the best-run companies unexpected

 Great companies will constantly be trying to produce and sell new products

 These disappointments are an inevitable part of even the most successful

 If met forthrightly and with good judgment, they are merely one of the

 They are frequently a sign of strength rather than weakness in a company.

How a management reacts to such matters can be a valuable clue to the investor.
 The management that does not report as freely when things are going badly

 rather significant reasons.
 It may not have a program worked out to solve the unanticipated difficulty.
 It may have become panicky.
 It may not have an adequate sense of responsibility to its stockholders,
 seeing no reason why it should report more than what may seem expedient

\begin_layout Itemize
The management of a company is always far closer to its assets than is the
 stockholder.
 The number of ways management can benefit at the expense of the ordinary
 stockholder is almost infinite.
 One way is to put themselves on the payroll payroll at salaries far above
 the normal worth of the work performed.
 Another is to own properties they sell or rent to the corporation at above-mark
et rates.
 Another method for insiders to enrich themselves is to get the corporation's
 vendors to sell through certain brokerage firms which perform little if
 any service for the brokerage commissions involved but which are owned
 by these same insiders and relatives or friends.
 Probably most costly of all to the investor is the abuse by insiders of
 their power of issuing common stock options.
 They can pervert this legitimate method of compensating able management
 by issuing to themselves amounts of stock far beyond what an unbiased outsider
 might judge to represent a fair reward for services performed.

 From this point it will only do about as well as industry as a whole.

Another and even more costly reason why an investor should never sell out
 of an outstanding situation because of the possibility that an ordinary
 bear market may be about to occur.
 Frequently, in the past, as many investors were fooling themselves, the
 bear market never came and the stock went right on up after their selling.
 And when a bear market has come, investors actually aren't going back into
 the same shares before they had gone up above his selling price.
 Usually they either waited for them to go far lower than they actually
 dropped, or, when they were way down, fear of something else happening
 still prevented their reinstatement.

 worth something.

 Such groups have management talent available to bolster up weak spots as

 Those who are not in a position to supply such talent and to convince new
 managements of the need of taking advantage of such help will find investing
 in promotional companies largely a disillusioning experience.
 There are enough spectacular opportunities among established companies
 that ordinary individual investors should make it a rule never to buy into
 a promotional enterprise, no matter how attractive it may appear to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The heart of successful investing is finding companies which are developing
 new products and processes or exploiting new markets.
 Companies that have just started or are about to be started are frequently
 attempting to do just this.
 Many of them are formed to develop a colorful new invention.
 Many are started to participate in industries in which there is great growth
 potential.
 Young companies not yet earning a profit on their operations may at first
 glance appear to be of investment value.
 Or buying IPO companies.
 It's probably better to deal with established companies, you can observe
 the company's production, sales, cost accounting, management teamwork,
 and all other aspects of its operations.
 Perhaps even more important, he can obtain the opinion of other qualified
 observers who are in a position to observe regularly some or all of these
 points of relative strength or weakness in the company under consideration.
 In contrast, when a company is still in the promotional stage, all an investor
 can do is look at a blueprint and guess what the problems and the strong

 It is important to go beyond them to the underlying facts.

There is a disadvantage of having "eggs in too many baskets".
 It's impossible to keep watching all the baskets after the eggs get put
 into them.
 Investors have been so oversold on diversification that fear of having
 too many eggs in one basket has caused them to put far too little into
 companies they thoroughly know and far too much in others about which they
 know nothing at all.
 It never seems to occur to them, much less to their advisers, that buying
 a company without having sufficient knowledge of it may be even more dangerous
 than having inadequate diversification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some companies even have a considerable degree of diversification within
 the company itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The breadth and depth of a company's management personnel-that is, how far
 a company has progressed away from one-man management-are also important
 factors in deciding how much diversification protection is intrinsically
 needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The relationship between the industries involved will also be a factor.
 For example, an investor with ten stocks in equal amounts, but 8 of them
 bank stocks, may have completely inadequate diversification.
 In contrast, the same investor with each of his ten stocks in a completely
 different industry may have far more diversification than he really needs.
\end_layout

Each case is different and no precise rules can be laid down, but Fisher
 suggests the following as minimum diversification needs:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
All investments might be confined solely to the large entrenched type of
 properly selected growth stocks.
 Here, an investor might have a minimum goal of 5 such stocks in all.
 This means that he would not invest over 20% of his total original commitment
 in any one of these stocks.
 Original holding though - so if one grows more rapidly than the rest, say
 it's 40%, he shouldn't disturb such a holding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some or all of his investments might fall into the category of stocks about
 midway between the young growth companies with their high degree of risk
 and the institutional type of investment described above.
 These would be companies with a good management team rather than one-man
 management.
 At least two of such companies should be considered as necessary to balance
 each single company of the type A.
 In other words, if only companies in this B group were involved, an investor
 might start out with 10% of his available funds in each.
 This would make a total of 10 stocks in all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally there are the small companies with staggering possibilities of gain
 for successful, but complete or almost complete loss of investment for
 the unsuccessful.
 The amount, if any, of such securities in an investment list should vary
 according to the circumstances and goals of the particular investor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Here, never put any funds into these that you cannot afford to lose.
 Also, larger investors should never at the time of the original investment
 put over 5% of available funds into only one such company.
 One of the risks of the small investor is that he may be too small to obtain
 the spectacular prospects of this type of investment and still get the
 benefits of proper diversification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One characteristic of this type of company should be kept in mind from the
 standpoint of diversification.
 They entail so much risk and offer such promising prospects that, in time,
 one of two things usually happens.
 Either they fail, or else they grow in trade position, management depth,
 and competitive strength to a point where they can be classified in the
 B rather than the C group.
 When this happens, the shares held in them usually have advanced so spectacular
ly in market price that, depending on what has happened to the value of
 an investor's other holdings during the period, they may then represent
 a considerably greater % of the total portfolio than they formerly did.
 However, B stocks are much safer than C stocks that they may be retained
 in greater volume without sacrificing proper diversification.
 Therefore, if a company has changed in this way, there is seldom reason
 to sell stock-at least not on the ground that the market rise has resulted
 in this company representing too great a percentage of total holdings.
 So it no longer carried with it the element of extreme investment risk.
 When this point had been reached, a considerably larger percentage of total
 investment might be held in these companies without violating principles
 of prudent diversification.
\end_layout

Usually a very long list of securities is not a sign of the brilliant investor,
 but of one who is unsure of himself.
 If the investor owns stock in so many companies that he cannot keep in
 touch with their managements directly or indirectly, he is rather sure
 to end up in worse shape than if he had owned stock in too few companies.
 An investor should always realize that some mistakes are going to be make
 and that he should have sufficient diversification so that an occasional
 mistake will not prove crippling.
 However, beyond this point he should take extreme care to own not the most,
 but the best.
 In the field of common stocks, a little bit of a great many can never be
 more than a poor substitute for a few of the outstanding.

Don't be afraid of buying on a war scare
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Every time the international stresses of our world produce either a war
 scare or an actual war, common stocks reflect it.
 This is a psychological phenomenon which makes little sense financially.
 Every time major war has broken out anywhere in the world or whenever American
 forces have become involved in any fighting whatever, the American stock
 market has always plunged sharply downward.
 But historically, the stocks usually rebounded sharply as the war scare
 subsided.
 Modern war always causes governments to spend far more than they can possibly
 collect from their taxpayers while the war is being waged.
 This causes a vast increase in the amount of money, so that each individual
 unit of money, such as a dollar, becomes worth less than it was before.
 It takes lots more dollars to buy the same number of shares of stock.
 This is the classic form of inflation.
 In other words, war is always bearish on money.
 To sell stock at the threatened or actual outbreak of hostilities so as
 to get into cash is extreme financial lunacy.
 Actually just the opposite should be done.
 In an investor has about decided to buy a particular common stock and the
 arrival of a full-blown war scare starts knocking down the price, he should
 ignore the scare psychology of the moment and definitely begin buying.
 This is the time when having surplus cash for investment becomes least,
 not most, desirable.
 However - how fast should he buy? How far down will the stock go? There
 is no way of knowing.
 Therefore, the thing to do is to buy but buy slowly and at a scale-down
 on just a threat of war.
 If war occurs, then increase the tempo of buying significantly.
 Just be sure to buy into companies either with products or services the
 demand for which will continue in wartime, or which can convert their facilitie
s to wartime operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do stocks actually become more valuable in war time, or is it just money
 which declines in value? That depends on circumstances - which country

 It would then make little difference what investors might have done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The reason for buying stocks on war or fear of war is not that war, in itself,
 is ever again likely to be profitable to American stockholders.

 which are expressed in units of money, always go up.

There are certain superficial financial statistics which are frequently
 given an undeserved degree of attention by many investors.
 Maybe they have very little to do with your investment case.
 For example, price ranges at which a stock has sold in former years.
 The price at which the stock sold 4 years ago may have little or no relationshi
p to the price at which it sells today.
 The company may have developed a host of able new executives, a series
 of new and highly profitable products, or any number of similar desirable
 attributes that make the stock intrinsically worth four times as much in
 relation to the price of other stocks as it was worth 4 years ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarly, many investors will give heavy weight to the per-share earnings
 of the past 5 years in trying to decide whether a stock should be bought.
 What counts is knowledge of background conditions.
 An understanding of what probably will happen over the next several years
 is of overriding importance.
 The investor is constantly being fed a diet of reports and so-called analyses
 largely centered around these price figures for the past 5 years.
 He should keep in mind that it is the next five years' earnings, not those
 of the past 5 years, that now matter to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, some investors pay undue attention to unrelated statistics on past
 price ranges and per-share earnings.
 This is the belief that whatever has happened for a number of years is
 bound to continue indefinitely.
 In other words, some investors will find a stock the per-share earnings
 and market price of which ave risen in each of the past 5 or 10 years.
 They will conclude that this trend is almost certain to continue indefinitely.
 This might happen, but in view of the uncertainty in timing the results
 of research and of the costliness of bringing out the new products that
 make this type of growth possible, it is quite common for even the most
 outstanding growth companies to have occasional one- to three-year dips
 in their irate of earnings.
 Such dips can produce sharp declines in their shares.
 Therefore, to give emphasis to this kind of past earning record, rather
 than to the background conditions that can control the future earning curve,
 may prove very costly.
 But still, past earnings and price ranges shouldn't be completely ignored.
 They are helpful as long as it is realized they are only auxiliary tools
 to be used for specialized purposes and not major factors in deciding the
 attractiveness of a common stock.
 Thus, for example, a study of per-share earnings for various prior years
 will throw considerable light on how cyclical a stock may be, that is,
 on how much the company's profits will be affected by the varying stages
 of the business cycle.
 More important, comparing past per-share earnings with price ranges will
 furnish the price-earnings ratio at which the stock sold in the past.
 This serves as a base from which to start measuring what the price-earnings
 ratio may be in the future.
 But it must be kept in mind that it is the future and not the past which
 governs.

Some investment fads and misinterpretations of facts may run for several

 for a time, cause the affected stocks to go too far in the opposite direction.
 The ability to see through some majority opinions to find what facts are
 really there is a trait that can bring rich rewards in the field of common
 stocks.
 It is not easy to develop, however, for the composite opinion of those
 with whom we associate is a powerful influence upon the minds of us all.
 There is one factor which all of us can recognize, however, and which can
 help powerfully in not just following the crowd.
 This is realization that the financial community is usually slow to recognize
 a fundamentally changed condition, unless a big name or a colorful single
 event is publicly associated with that change.
 For example a widely known man is put in as the new president.
 Recognizing such situations-prior to the price spurt that will inevitably
 accompany the financial community's correction of its appraisal-is one
 of the first and simplest ways in which the fledgling investor can practice
 thinking for himself rather than following the crowd.

A corporation of the size and type to provide a conservative investment

 It must have superiority in production, marketing, research, and financial
 skills.
 So it's a very low-cost producer or operator in its field, has outstanding
 marketing and financial ability and a demonstrated above-average skill
 on the complex managerial problem of attaining worthwhile results from
 its research or technological organization.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Low-cost production (comparing its competition) - it must also give promise
 of continuing to be so in the future.
 Greater-than-average profit margin should enable a company to earn enough
 to generate internally a significant part or perhaps all of the funds required
 for financing growth.
 This avoids much or even all of the need for raising additional long-term
 capital that can a) result in new shares being issued and diluting the
 value of already outstanding shares and/or b) create an additional burden
 of debt, with fixed interest payments and fixed maturities (which must
 largely be met from future earnings) which greatly increase the risks of
 the common-stock owners.
 This can be applied to both, manufacturing companies, as well as companies
 that are in service lines, retailing, or one of the many subdivisions of
 the financial world such as banking or insurance.
 So this was about low-cost production or operations.

Strong marketing organization - recognizing changes in public taste and
 then reacting promptly to these changes is not enough.
 As has been said before, in the business world customers simply do not
 beat a path to the door of the man with the better mousetrap.
 In the competitive world of commerce it is vital to make the potential
 customer aware of the advantages of a product or service.
 This awareness can be created only by understanding what the potential
 buyer really wants (sometimes when the customer himself doesn't clearly
 recognize why these advantages appeal to him) and explaining it to him
 not in the seller’s terms but in his terms.
 Whether this is best done by advertising, by salesmen making calls, by
 specialized independent marketing organizations, or by any combination
 of these depends on the nature of the business.
 An efficient producer or operator with weak marketing and selling may be
 compared to a powerful engine that, because of a loose pulley belt or badly
 adjusted differential, is producing only a fraction of the results it otherwise
 would have attained.

 same amount of its assets was employed in some other way? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In today’s highly fluid and competitive business world, obtaining well-above-ave
rage profit margins or a high return on assets is so desirable that, whenever
 a company accomplishes this goal for any significant period of time, it
 is bound to be faced with a host of potential competitors.
 If the potential competitors actually enter the field, they will cut into
 markets the established company now has.
 Normally, when potential competition becomes actual competition the ensuing
 struggle for sales results in anything from a minor to a major reduction
 in the high profit margin that had theretofore existed.
 High profit margins may be compared to an open jar of honey owned by the
 prospering company.
 The honey will inevitably attract a swarm of hungry insects bent on devouring
 it.
 In the business world there are but two ways a company can protect the
 contents of its honey jar from being consumed by the insects of competition.
 One is by monopoly, which is usually illegal, although, if the monopoly
 is due to patent protection, it may not be.
 In any event, monopolies are likely to end quite suddenly and do not commend
 themselves as vehicles for the safest type of investing.
 The other way for the honey-jar company to keep the insects out is to operate
 so much more efficiently than others that there is no incentive for present
 or potential competition to take action that will upset the existing situation.

\begin_layout Itemize
Every significant price move of any individual common stock in relation
 to stocks as a whole occurs because of a changed appraisal of that stock
 by the financial community.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The matter of “appraisal” is the heart of understanding the seeming vagaries
 of price-earnings ratios.
 It should never be forgotten that an appraisal is a subjective matter.
 It has nothing necessarily to do with what is going on in the real world
 about us.
 Rather, it results from what the person doing the appraising believes is
 going on, no matter how far from the actual facts such a judgment may be.
 In other words, any individual stock does not rise or fall at any particular
 moment in time because of what is actually happening or will happen to
 that company.
 It rises or falls according to the current consensus of the financial community
 as to what is happening and will happen regardless of how far off this
 consensus may be from what is really occurring or will occur.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There can be a wide variations between the financial community’s appraisal
 of a stock and the true set of conditions affecting it that may last for
 several years.
 Always, however—sometimes within months, sometimes only after a much longer
 period of time—the bubble bursts.
 When a stock has been selling too high because of unrealistic expectations,
 sooner or later a growing number of stockholders grow tired of waiting.
 Their selling soon more than exhausts the buying power of the small number
 of additional buyers who still have faith in the old appraisal.
 The stock then comes tumbling down.
 Sometimes the new appraisal that follows is quite realistic.
 Frequently, however, as this re-examination evolves under the emotional
 pressure of falling prices, the negative is overemphasized, resulting in
 a new financial-community appraisal that is significantly less favorable
 than the facts warrant and that may then prevail for some time.
 However, when this happens, much the same thing occurs as when the appraisal
 is too favorable.
 The only difference is that the process is reversed.
 It may take months or years for a more favorable image to supplant the
 existing one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the lowest end of the risk scale and most suitable for wise investment
 is the company that measures quite high in regard to the first three dimensions
 but currently is appraised by the financial community as less worthy, and
 therefore has a lower price-earnings ratio, than these fundamental facts
 warrant.
 Next least risky and usually quite suitable for intelligent investment
 is the company rating quite high in regard to the first three dimensions
 and having an image and therefore a price-earnings ratio reasonably in
 line with these fundamentals.
 This is because such a company will continue to grow if it truly has these
 attributes.
 Next least risky and, in my opinion, usually suitable for retention by
 conservative investors who own them but not for fresh purchase with new
 funds are companies that are equally strong in regard to the first three
 dimensions but, because these qualities have become almost legendary in
 the financial community, have an appraisal or price-earnings ratio higher
 than is warranted by even the strong fundamentals.
 In Fisher's opinion there are important reasons such stocks should usually
 be retained, even though their prices seem too high: If the fundamentals
 are genuinely strong, these companies will in time increase earnings not
 only enough to justify present prices but to justify considerably higher
 prices.
 Meanwhile, the number of truly attractive companies in regard to the first
 three dimensions is fairly small.
 Undervalued ones are not easy to find.
 The risk of making a mistake and switching into one that seems to meet
 all of the first three dimensions but actually does not is probably considerabl
y greater for the average investor than the temporary risk of staying with
 a thoroughly sound but currently overvalued situation until genuine value
 catches up with current prices.
 Investors who agree with me on this particular point must be prepared for
 occasional sharp contractions in the market value of these temporarily
 overvalued stocks.
 On the other hand, it is my observation that those who sell such stocks
 to wait for a more suitable time to buy back these same shares seldom attain
 their objective.
 They usually wait for a decline to be bigger than it actually turns out
 to be.
 The result is that some years later when this fundamentally strong stock
 has reached peaks of value considerably higher than the point at which
 they sold, they have missed all of this later move and may have gone into
 a situation of considerably inferior intrinsic quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Continuing up our scale of ascending risks, we come next to the stocks that
 are average or relatively low in quality in regard to the first three dimension
s but have an appraisal in the financial community either lower than, or
 about in line with, these not very attractive fundamentals.
 Those with a poorer appraisal than basic conditions warrant may be good
 speculations but are not suitable for the prudent investor.
 In the fast-moving world of today there is just too much danger of adverse
 developments severely affecting such shares.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally we come to what is by far the most dangerous group of all: companies
 with a present financial-community appraisal or image far above what is
 currently justified by the immediate situation.
 Purchase of such shares can cause the sickening losses that tend to drive
 investors away from stock ownership in droves and threaten to shake the
 investment industry to its foundations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Regarding appraisals - there are three separate appraisals: the current
 financial-community appraisal of the attractiveness of common stocks as
 a whole, of the industry of which the particular company is a part, and,
 finally, of the company itself.

\begin_layout Itemize
The conservative investor must be aware of the nature of the current financial-c

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The further into the future profits will continue to grow, the higher the
 price-earnings ratio an investor can afford to pay.
 This rule, however, should be applied with great caution.
 It should never be forgotten that the actual variations in price-earnings
 ratio will result not from what will actually happen but from what the
 financial community currently believes will happen.
 In a period of general market optimism a stock may sell at an extremely
 high price-earnings ratio because the financial community quite correctly
 envisages many years of great growth ahead.
 But many years will have to elapse before this growth is fully realized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The only true test of whether a stock is “cheap” or “high” is not its current
 price in relation to some former price, no matter how accustomed we may
 have become to that former price, but whether the company’s fundamentals
 are significantly more or less favorable than the current financial community
 appraisal of that stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As previously mentioned, there is a third element of investment community
 appraisal that also must be considered, along with its appraisal of the
 industry and of the particular company.
 Only after all three are blended together can a worthwhile judgment be
 reached as to whether a stock is cheap or high at any given time.
 This third appraisal is that of the outlook for stocks in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The level of stocks as a whole is not solely a matter of image but results
 partly from the financial community’s current appraisal of the degree of
 attractiveness of common stocks and partly from a certain purely financial
 factor from the real world.
 This real-world factor is mainly involved with interest rates.
 When interest rates are high in either the long- or short-term money markets,
 and even more so when they are high in both, there is a tendency for a
 larger part of the pool of investment capital to flow toward those markets,
 so the demand for stocks is less.
 Stocks may be sold to transfer funds to these markets.
 Conversely, when rates are low, funds flow out of those markets and into
 stocks.
 Therefore, higher interest rates tend to lower the level of all stocks
 and lower interest rates to raise that level.
 Similarly, when the public is in a mood to save a larger percentage of
 its income, more funds flow into the total capital pool and there is a
 more bullish pull on stock prices than when the pool of capital funds is
 rising more slowly.
 However, this is a much smaller influence than is the level of interest
 rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The price of any particular stock at any particular moment is determined
 by the current financial-community appraisal of the particular company,
 of the industry it is in, and to some degree of the general level of stock
 prices.
 Determining whether at that moment the price of a stock is attractive,
 unattractive or somewhere in between depends for the most part on the degree
 these appraisals vary from reality.
 However, to the extent that the general level of stock prices affects the
 total picture, it also depends somewhat on correctly estimating coming
 changes in certain purely financial factors, of which interest rates are
 by far the most important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stay or sell in anticipation of possible market downturns.
 Putting it in the simplest mathematical terms, both the odds and the risk/rewar
d considerations favor holding.
 There is a much greater chance of being wrong in estimating adverse short-term
 changes for a good stock than in projecting its strong, long-term price
 appreciation potential.
 Fisher had a belief that the short-term price movements are so inherently
 tricky to predict that he does not believe it possible to play the in and
 out game and still make the enormous profits that have accrued again and
 again to the truly long-term holder of the right stocks.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
"My philosophy calls for making a relatively small number of investments

 I study.
 As important, I am trying, through my analysis, to avoid risk."

Functional factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The firm must be one of the lowest-cost producers of its products or services
 relative to its competition, and must promise to remain so.
 a.
 A comparatively low break-even will enable this firm to survive depressed
 market conditions and to strengthen its market and pricing position when
 weaker competitors are driven out of the market.
 b.
 A higher than average profit margin enables the firm to generate more funds
 internally to sustain growth without as much dilution caused by equity
 sales or strain caused by over-dependence on fixed-income financing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A firm must have a strong enough customer orientation to recognize changes
 in customer needs and interests and then to react promptly to those changes
 in an appropriate manner.
 This capability should lead to generating a flow of new products that more
 than offset lines maturing or becoming obsolete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Effective marketing requires not only understanding of what customers want,
 but also explaining to them (through advertising, selling or other means)
 in terms the customer will understand.
 Close control and constant monitoring of the cost/effectiveness of market
 efforts are required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even nontechnical firms today require a strong and well-directed research
 capability to (a) produce newer and better products, and (b) perform services
 in a more effective or efficient way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There are wide differences in the effectiveness of research.
 Two important elements of more productive research are (a) market/ profit
 consciousness, and (b) the ability to pool necessary talent into an effective
 working team.

 Teamwork, as distinct from dysfunction struggles for power, is critical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Attention must be paid to attracting competent managers at lower levels
 and to training them for larger responsibilities.
 Succession should largely be from the available talent pool.
 The need to recruit the chief executive from outside is a particularly
 dangerous sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The entrepreneurial spirit must permeate the organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
More successful firms usually have some unique personality traits—some special

 This is a positive not a negative sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Management must recognize and be attuned to the fact that the world in which
 they are operating is changing at an ever increasing rate.
 a.
 Every accepted way of doing things must be reexamined periodically, and
 new, better ways sought.
 b.
 Changes in managerial approaches involve necessary risks, which must be
 recognized, minimized and taken.

Business characteristics

\begin_layout Enumerate
Although managers rely heavily on return of assets in considering new investment
s, investors must recognize that historic assets stated at historic costs
 distort comparisons of firms’ performance.
 Favorable profit to sales ratios, notwithstanding differences in turnover
 ratios, may be a better indicator of the safety of an investment, particularly
 in an inflationary environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
High margins attract competition, and competition erodes profit opportunities.
 The best way to mute competition is to operate so efficiently that there
 is no incentive left for the potential entrant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Efficiencies of scale are often counterbalanced by the inefficiencies of
 bureaucratic layers of middle management.
 In a well-run firm, however, the industry leadership position creates a
 strong competitive advantage that should be attractive to investors.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Getting there first in a new product market is a long step toward becoming

\begin_layout Enumerate
Products are not islands.
 There is an indirect competition, for example, for consumers’ dollars.
 As prices change, some products may lose attractiveness even in well-run,
 low-cost companies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is hard to introduce new, superior products in market arenas where establishe
d competitors already have a strong position.
 While the new entrant is building the production, marketing power, and
 reputation to be competitive, existing competitors can take strong defensive
 actions to regain the market threatened.
 Innovators have a better chance of success if they combine technology disciplin
es, e.g., electronics and nucleonics, in a way that is novel relative to existing
 competitive competencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Technology is just one avenue to industry leadership.
 Developing a consumer “franchise” is another.
 Service excellence is still another.
 Whatever the case, a strong ability to defend established markets against
 new competitors is essential for a sound investment.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summary of Philip Fisher's strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Buy into companies that have disciplined plans for achieving dramatic long-range
 growth in profits and that have inherent qualities making it difficult
 for newcomers to share in that growth.
 There are so many details, both favorable and unfavorable, that should
 also be considered in selecting one of these companies that it is obviously
 impossible in a monograph of this length to cover them adequately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Focus on buying these companies when they are out of favor; that is, when,
 either because of general market conditions or because the financial community
 at the moment has misconceptions of its true worth, the stock is selling
 at prices well under what it will be when its true merit is better understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Hold the stock until either (a) there has been a fundamental change in its
 nature (such as a weakening of management through changed personnel), or
 (b) it has grown to a point where it no longer will be growing faster than
 the economy as a whole.
 Only in the most exceptional circumstances, if ever, sell because of forecasts
 as to what the economy or the stock market is going to do, because these
 changes are too difficult to predict.
 Never sell the most attractive stocks you own for short-term reasons.
 However, as companies grow, remember that many companies that are quite
 efficiently run when they are small fail to change management style to
 meet the different requirements of skill big companies need.
 When management fails to grow as companies grow, shares should be sold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For those primarily seeking major appreciation of their capital, de-emphasize
 the importance of dividends.
 The most attractive opportunities are most likely to occur in the profitable,
 but low or no dividend payout groups.
 Unusual opportunities are much less likely to be found in situations where
 high percentage of profits is paid to stockholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Making some mistakes is as much an inherent cost of investing for major
 gains as making some bad loans is inevitable in even the best run and most
 profitable lending institution.
 The important thing is to recognize them as soon as possible, to understand
 their causes, and to learn how to keep from repeating the mistakes.
 Willingness to take small losses in some stocks and to let profits grow
 bigger and bigger in the more promising stocks is a sign of good investment
 management.
 Taking small profits in good investments and letting losses grow in bad
 ones is a sign of abominable investment judgment.
 A profit should never be taken just for the satisfaction of taking it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There are a relatively small number of truly outstanding companies.
 Their shares frequently can’t be bought at attractive prices.
 Therefore, when favorable prices exist, full advantage should be taken
 of the situation.
 Funds should be concentrated in the most desirable opportunities.
 For those involved in venture capital and quite small companies, say with
 annual sales of under $25,000,000, more diversification may be necessary.
 For larger companies, proper diversification requires investing in a variety
 of industries with different economic characteristics.
 For individuals (in possible contrast to institutions and certain types
 of funds), any holding of over twenty different stocks is a sign of financial
 incompetence.
 Ten or twelve is usually a better number.
 Sometimes the costs of the capital gains tax may justify taking several
 years to complete a move toward concentration.
 As an individual’s holdings climb toward as many as twenty stocks, it nearly
 always is desirable to switch from the least attractive of these stocks
 to more of the attractive.
 It should be remembered that ERISA stands for Emasculated Results: Insufficient
 Sophisticated Action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A basic ingredient of outstanding common stock management is the ability
 neither to accept blindly whatever may be the dominant opinion in the financial
 community at the moment nor to reject the prevailing view just to be contrary
 for the sake of being contrary.
 Rather, it is to have more knowledge and to apply better judgment, in thorough
 evaluation of specific situations, and the moral courage to act “in opposition
 to the crowd” when your judgment tells you you are right.

 side of Berkshire's business:
\emph on
 "Picking the right person(s) will not be an easy task.
 It's not hard, of course, to find smart people, among them individuals
 who have impressive investment records.
 But there is far more to successful long-term investing than brains and
 performance that has recently been good.
 Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things.
 A single, big mistake could wipe out a long string of successes.
 We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid
 serious risks, including those never before encountered.
 Certain perils that lirk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by
 use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions.
 Temperament is also important.
 Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen understanding of
 both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term investment
 success.
 I've seen a lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues.
 Also, we need to keep the people we hire."

First, we do not want to maximize the price at which Berkshire shares trade.
 We wish instead for them to trade in a narrow range centered at intrinsic
 business value.
 Charlie and I are bothered as much by significant overvaluation as significant
 undervaluation.
 Both extremes will inevitably produce results for many shareholders that
 will differ sharply from Berkshire's business results.
 If our stock price instead consistently mirrors business value, each of
 our shareholders will receive an investment result that roughly parallels
 the business results of Berkshire during his holding period.

Second, we wish for very little trading activity.
 If we ran a private business with a few passive partners, we would be disappoin
ted if those partners, and their replacements, frequently wnated to leave
 the partnership.
 Running a public company, we feel the same way.
 Our goal is to attract long-term owners who, at the time of purchase, have
 no timetable or price target for sale but plan instead to stay with us
 indefinitely.
 We don't understand the CEO who wants lots of stock activity, for that
 can be achieved only if many of his owners are constantly exiting.

\begin_layout Itemize
Buffett thinks most markets are not purely efficient and that equating volatilit
y with risk is a gross distortion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assessing investment risk requires thinking about a company's management,
 products, competitors, and debt levels.
 The inquiry is whether after-tax returns on an investment are at least
 equal to the purchasing power of the initial investment plus a fair rate
 of return.
 The primary relevant factors are the long-term economic characteristics
 of a business, the quality and integrity of its management, and future
 levels of taxation and inflation.
 Maybe these factors are vague, particularly compared with the seductive
 precision of beta, but the point is that judgments about such matters cannot
 be avoided, except to an investor's disadvantage.

Graham held that price is what you pay and value is what you get.
 These two things are rarely identical, but most people rarely notice any
 difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another prudential legacy from Graham is his margin-of-safety principle.
 This principle holds that one should not make an investment in a security
 unless there is a sufficient basis for believing that the price being paid
 is substantially lower than the value being delivered.
 Buffett follows the principle devotedly, noting that Graham had said that
 if forced to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, they
 would be: margin of safety.
 Over 40 years after first reading that, Buffett still thinks those are
 the right words.
 While modern finance theory enthusiasts cite market efficiency to deny
 there is a difference between price (what you pay) and value (what you
 get), Buffett and Graham regard it as all the difference in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That difference also shows that the term "value investing" is a redundancy.
 All true investing must be based on an assessment of the relationship between
 price and value.
 Strategies that do not employ this comparison of price and value do not
 amount to investing at all, but to speculation - the hope that price will
 rise, rather than the conviction that the price being paid is lower than
 the value being obtained.
 Many professionals make another common mistake, Buffett notes, by distinguishin
g between "growth investing" and "value investing".
 Growth and value, Buffett says, are not distinct.
 They are integrally linked since growth must be treated as a component
 of value.

 Some people might call this scalping: it won't surprise you that practitioners
 opted for the French term, arbitrage.
 Since World War I the definition or arbitrage - or "risk arbitrage", as
 it is now sometimes called - has expanded to include the pursuit of profits
 from an announced corporate event such as sale of the company, merger,
 recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, self-tender, etc.

Berkshire's arbitrage activities differ from those of many arbitrageurs.
 First, they participate in only a few, and usually very large, transactions
 each year.
 Most practitioners buy into a great many deals - perhaps 50 or more per
 year.
 With that many irons in the fire, they must spend most of their time monitoring
 both the progress of deals and the market movements of the related stocks.
 This is not how Munger and Buffett wish to spend their lives.
 What's the sense in getting rich just to stare at a ticker tape all day?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, they participate only in transactions that have been publicly announced.
 They don't trade on rumors or try to guess takeover candidates.
 They just read the newspapers, think about a few of the big propositions,
 and go by their own sense of probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Their arbitrage positions are a substitute for short-term cash equivalents.
 They engage in arbitrage from time to time - sometimes on a large scale
 - but only when they like the odds.

\begin_layout Itemize
An investor cannot obtain superior profits from stocks by simply committing
 to a specific investment category or style.
 He can earn them only by carefully evaluating facts and continuously exercising

 Investing in arbitrage situations, per se, is no better a strategy than
 selecting a portfolio by throwing darts.

\begin_layout Itemize
"You can't go broke taking a profit" - can you imagine a CEO using this
 line to urge his board to sell a star subsidiary? In Buffet's view, what
 makes sense in business also makes sense in stocks: an investor should
 ordinarily hold a small piece of an outstanding business with the same
 tenacity that an owner would exhibit if he owned all of that business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
available at a very attractive price
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What's attractive? Most analysts feel they must choose between 2 approaches
 customarily thought to be in opposition: "value" and "growth".
 Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as
 intellectual cross-dressing.
 Buffett and Munger view that as a fuzzy thinking (it must be confessed
 that Buffett engaged himself some years ago).
 In Buffet's opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: growth is
 always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable
 whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact
 can be negative as well as positive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In addition, Buffet thinks that the term "value investing" is redundant.
 What is investing if it is not the act of seeking value at least sufficient
 to justify the amount paid? Consciously paying more for a stock than its
 calculated value - in the hope that it can soon be sold for a still-higher
 price - should be labeled speculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whether appropriate or not, the term "value investing" is widely used.
 Typically, it connotes the purchase of stocks having attributes such as
 a low ratio of price to book value, a P/E ratio or a high dividend yield.
 Unfortunately, such characteristics, even if they appear in combination,
 are far from determinative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something
 for what it is worth and truly operating on the principle of obtaining
 value in his investments.
 Correspondingly, opposite characteristics - a high ratio of P/B value,
 high P/E ratio, and a low dividend yield - are in no way inconsistent with
 a "value" purchase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarly, business growth, per se, tells us little about value.
 It's true that growth often has a positive impact on value, sometimes on
 of spectacular proportions.
 But such an effect is far from certain.
 Growth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at
 incremental returns that are enticing - in other words, only when each
 dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of long-term market
 value.
 In the case of a low-return business requiring incremental funds, growth
 hurts the investor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In The Theory of Investment Value, written in 1938, John Burr Williams set
 forth the equation for value, which we condense here: "The value of any
 stock, bond or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows
 - discounted at an appropriate interest rate - that can be expected to
 occur during the remaining life of the asset." Note that the formula is
 the same for stocks as for bonds.
 There is an important difference between the two: a bond has a coupon and
 maturity date that define future cash flows; but in the case of equities,
 the investment analyst must himself estimate the future "coupons." Furthermore,
 the quality of management affects the bond coupon only rarely - chiefly
 when management is so inept or dishonest that payment of interest is suspended.
 In contrast, the ability of management can dramatically affect the equity
 "coupons".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The investment shown by the discounted-flows-of-cash calculation to be the
 cheapest is the one that the investor should purchase - irrespective of
 whether the business grows or doesn't, displays volatility or smoothness
 in its earnings, or carries a high price or low price in relation to its
 current earnings and book value.
 Moreover, though the value equation has usually shown equities to be cheaper
 than bonds, that result is not inevitable: when bonds are calculated to
 be the more attractive investment, they should be bought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Though the mathematical calculations required to evaluate equities are not
 difficult, an analyst can easily go wrong in estimating future "coupons".
 At Berkshire, they attempt to deal with this problem in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
First, they try to stick to businesses they believe they understand.
 That means they must be relatively simple and stable in character.
 If a business is complex or subject to constant change, they are not smart
 enough to predict future cash flows.
 What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but
 rather how realistically they define what they don't know.
 An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids
 big mistakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Second, they insist on a margin of safety in the purchase price.
 If they calculate the value of a common stock to be only slightly higher
 than its price, they are not interested in buying.
 They believe that this principle is the cornerstone of investment success.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Buffet and Munger on fast-changing industry environment - these may offer
 the chance for huge wins, but it precludes the certainty they seek.
 They welcome change - fresh ideas, new products, innovative processes,
 and the like cause that the USA's standard of living will rise.
 However, as investors, their reaction to a fermenting industry is much
 like their attitude toward space exploration: they applaud the endeavor
 but prefer to skip the ride.

A few thoughts about index funds: most investors (both institutional and
 individual) will find that the best way to own common stocks is through
 an index fund that charges minimal fees.
 Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees
 and expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment professionals.
 But there are few thoughts worth remembering.
 Intelligent investing is not complex, though that is far from saying that
 it is easy.
 What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate *selected*
 businesses - you don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many.
 You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence.
 The size of that circle is not very important; knowledge its boundaries,
 however, is vital.
 To invest successfully, you need not understand beta, efficient markets,
 modern portfolio theory, option pricing, or emerging markets.
 You may, in fact, be better off knowing nothing of these.
 In Buffett's view, investment students need only two well-taught courses
 (instead of those that are taught at most business schools) - how to value
 a business, and how to think about market prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price,
 a part interest in an easily understandable business whose earnings are
 virtually certain to be materially higher 5, 10, and 20 years from now.
 Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet these standards
 - so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount
 of stock.
 You must also resist the temptation to stray from your guidelines: if you
 aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning
 it for 10 minutes.
 Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward
 over the years, and so also will the porfolio's market value.

Leverage can be lethal to businesses.
 Companies with large debts often assume that these obligations can be refinance
d as they mature.
 That assumption is usually valid.
 Occasionally, though, either because of company-specific problems or worldwide
 shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by payment.
 For that, only cash will do the job.
 Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.
 In September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors
 of the economy came dangerously close to bringing our entire country to
 its knees.
 Having a lot of liquidity lets them sleep well.
 Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt
 in the economy, they will be equipped both financially and emotionally
 to play offense while others scramble for survival.

Warren Buffett on Mergers and Acquisitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Berkshire's acquisition policy is the double-barred approach: buying portions
 or all of business with excellent economic characteristics and run by managers
 Buffett and Munger like, trust, and admire.
 Contrary to common practice, Buffett argues that in buying all of a business,
 there is rarely any reason to pay a premium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The rare cases involve businesses with franchise characteristics - those
 that can raise prices without impairing sales volume or market share and
 only require incremental capital investment to increase both.
 Even ordinary managers can operate franchise businesses to generate high
 returns on capital.
 The second category of rare cases is where extraordinary managers exist
 who can achieve the difficult feat of identifying underperforming businesses,
 and apply extraordinary talent to unlock hidden value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These two categories are extremely limited, and certainly do not explain
 the hundreds of high-premium takeovers that occur annually.
 Buffett attributes high-premium takeovers outside those unusual categories
 to 3 motives of buying managers: the thrill of an acquisition, the thrill
 of enhanced size, and excessive optimism about synergies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buffett describes acquisitions as "buyer sells part of itself to acquire
 seller".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most acquisitions are value-decreasing, Buffett says.
 Finding the best value-enhancing transactions requires concentrating on
 opportunity costs, measured principally against the alternative of buying
 small pieces of excellent businesses through stock market purchases.
 Such concentration is alien to the manager obsessed with synergies and
 size, but a vital part of Berkshire's double-barreled investment approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Berkshire has additional advantages in acquisitions: a high quality stock
 to pay with and a substantial amount of managerial autonomy to offer once
 a deal is done - both rare in an acquiring company, Buffett says.
 Buffet also puts his money where his mouth is, reminding prospective sellers
 that Berkshire has acquired many of its businesses from family or other
 closely held groups, and inviting them to check with every previous seller
 about Berkshire's initial promises measured against its later actions.
 In short, Berkshire seeks to be the buyer of choice for attractive business
 sellers - a lesson so important that it explains why Buffett prefers to
 retain rather than sell even those acquired businesses that struggle against
 business headwinds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Over time, the skill with which a company's managers allocate capital has
 an enormous impact on the enterprise's value.
 Almost by definition, a really good business generates far more money (at
 least after its early years) than it can use internally.
 The company could, of course, distribute the money to shareholders by way
 of dividends or share repurchases.
 But often the CEO asks a strategic planning staff, consultants or investment
 bankers whether an acquisition or two might make sense.
 That's like asking your interior decorator whether you need a $50,000 rug.

 We then will try to use those funds in ways that build per-share intrinsic

Berkshire offers some advantages that most buyers do not.
 Practically all of these buyers will fall into one of two categories:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A company located elsewhere but operating in your business or in a business
 somewhat akin to yours.
 Such a buyer - no matter what promises are made - will usually have managers
 who feel they know how to run your business operations and, sooner or later,
 will want to apply some hands-on "help".
 If the acquiring company is much larger, it often will have squads of managers,
 recruited over the years in part by promises that they will get to run
 future acquisitions.
 They will have their own way of doing things and, even though your business
 record undoubtedly will be far better than theirs, human nature will at
 some point cause them to believe that their methods of operating are superior.
 You and your family probably have friends who have sold their businesses
 to larger companies, and I suspect that their experiences will confirm
 the tendency of parent companies to take over the running of their subsidiaries
, particularly when the parent knows the industry, or think it does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A financial maneuver, invariably operating with large amounts or borrowed
 money, who plans to resell either to the public or to another corporation
 as soon as the time is favorable.
 Frequently, this buyer's major contribution will be to change accounting
 methods so that earnings can be presented in the most favorable light just
 prior to his bailing out.
 This sort of transaction is becoming much more frequent because of a rising
 stock market and the great supply of funds available for such transactions.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Berkshire is another kind of buyer - a rather unusual one.
 Berkshire buys to keep, but Berkshire doesn't have, and doesn't expect
 to have, operating people in Berkshire's parent organization.
 All of the businesses they own are run autonomously to an extraordinary
 degree.
 In most cases, the managers of important businesses Berkshire has owned
 for many years have not been to Omaha or even met each other.
 When Berkshire buys a business, the sellers go on running it just as they
 did before the sale - Berkshire adapts to their methods rather than vice
 versa.
 The areas Buffett gets involved are in capital allocation and selection
 and compensation of the top man.
 Other personnel decisions, operating strategies etc are his bailiwick.
 Some Berkshire managers talk over some of their decisions with Buffett,
 some don't.
 It depends upon their personalities and, to an extent, upon their own personal
 relationship with me.
 If a company decides to do business with Berkshire, they would pay in cash.
 The business would not be used as collateral for any loan by Berkshire.
 There would be no brokers involved.

He recommends looking at company size first.
 Big companies make small stock moves, small companies make big stock moves.
 It's important to know the size of companies you're considering.
 After that, you should divide them into 6 categories: slow growers, stalwarts,

 The intent here is simply to know what kind of company you're investing

 It's important to know what you are buying.
 And also, companies move from category to category over time.

 As soon as a computer company designs the best word-processor, ten other
 competitors are spending $100 million to design a better one, and it will
 be on the market in 8 months.
 This doesn't happen with bottle caps or motel chains.
 In no-growth industry, especially one that's boring and upsets people,
 there's no problem with competition, so good competitive moat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It's got a niche.
 Also a competitive moat.

 You can be certain that at a minimum, the company will not go bankrupt

 Especially when employees with lower salaries (than CEOs and management)
 are buying.
 Insider selling usually means nothing, and it's silly to react to it.
 If nine officers were selling majority of their shares, it's different
 thing of course.
 But in normal situations insider selling isn't an automatic sign of trouble
 within a company.
 Maybe they need a money to pay their children's tuition of buy a new house,
 or just rebalance their portfolio.
 But there's only one reason that insiders buy - they think that stock price
 is undervalued and will eventually go up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Company is buying back shares.
 It is the simplest and best way a company can reward its investors.
 When stock is bought in by the company, it's taken out of circulation,
 therefore shrinking the number of outstanding shares.
 This can have a magical effect on earnings per share, which in turn has
 a magical effect on the stock price.
 Similar result can a company get by cutting costs or selling more widgets.
 The common alternatives to buying back shares are: raising the dividend,
 developing new products, starting new operations, and making acquisitions.
 Reverse of buying shares is adding more shares - diluting.
 This can be beneficial for raising cash to help survive a financial crisis
 for example.

Hottest stock in the hottest industry with the most favorable publicity

 These stocks goes up fast (months or a year), usually out of sight of any

 just as quickly.
 If you aren't clever at selling hot stocks (and the fact that you've bought
 them is a clue that you won't be), you'll soon see your profits turn into
 losses, because when the price falls, it's not going to fall slowly, nor
 it's likely to stop at the level where you jumped on.

Beware the next something.
 "The next something" is almost never the next something.

 For instance, if a stalwart has gone up 40%, and nothing wonderful has
 happened with the company to make me think there are pleasant surprises
 ahead, it's good to sell the stock and replace it with another stalwart
 that is attractive and hasn't gone up.
 If you don't want to sell all of it, then you can sell some of it.

By successfully rotating in and out of several stalwarts for modest gains,

Stalwarts (low risk, moderate gain)

These are companies such as Coca-Cola.
 These multibillion-dollar hulks are not exactly agile climbers, but they're
 faster than slow growers.
 These have 10-12% annual growth in earnings.
 Depending on when you buy them and at what price, you can make a sizable
 profit in stalwarts.
 But it depends on how long it can take to make some money on a given stalwart.
 If you own a stalwart and the stock's gone up 50% in a year or two, you
 have to wonder if maybe that's enough and begin to think about selling.
 How much you can expect to squeeze out of Colgate-Palmolive? You aren't
 going to become a millionaire off it the way you could with fast growers,
 unless there is some startling new development.
 Fifty percent in two years is what you'd be delighted to get from stalwart
 in most normal situations.
 With stalwarts you have to consider taking profits more readily.
 They are stocks that Lynch generally buys for a 30-50% gain, then sell

Lynch always keeps some stalwarts in his portfolio because they offer pretty
 good protection during recessions and hard times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you start thinking about stalwart, then the key issues are the price,

 There is no point in expecting a quick tenbagger in a stalwart, and if

 to buy it back later at a lower price - or buying something else.
 New products introduced in the last 2 years have had mixed results, and

 The stock has a P/E of 15 while similar-quality companies in the industry

 Actually, Lynch prefers slower industries.
 These enterprises learned to succeed in one place, and hen to duplicate

 earnings that drives the stock price to the highs.

\begin_layout Itemize
There is plenty of risk in fast growers, especially in he younger companies
 that tend to be overzealous and under-financed.
 Also, Wall Street does not look kindly on fast growers that run out of
 stamina and turn into slow growers, and when that happens, the stocks are
 beaten down accordingly.
 While slow fast growers risk extinction, the larger fast growers risk a
 rapid devaluation when they begin to falter.
 Once a fast grower gets too big, there is simply no place for it to stretch
 out.
 But for as long as they can keep it up, fast growers are the big winners
 in the stock market.
 Look for good balance sheets and those that are making substantial profits.
 The trick is to figuring out when they'll stop growing, and how much to
 pay for the growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you start thinking about fast grower, then where and how can it continue

 work elsewhere? Does the product that's supposed to enrich the company
 is a major part of the company's business? What the growth rate in earnings
 has been in recent years (20-25% are the best).
 Lynch is worried about companies with the growth faster than 25%.
 Those 50% are usually in hot industries, that can drop down very quickly.

 all cyclicals.
 For example Ford is a cyclical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Coming out of a recession and into a vigorous economy, the cyclicals flourish
 and their stock prices tend to rise much faster than the price of the stalwarts.
 This is understandable, since people buy new cars and take more airplane
 trips in a vigorous economy, and there's greater demand for steel, chemicals,
 etc.
 But going other direction, you can lose more than 50% of your investment
 very quickly if you buy cyclicals in the wrong part of the cycle, and it
 may be years before you'll see another upswing.

Cyclicals are the most misunderstood of all the types of stocks.
 It is here that the unwary stock-picker is most easily parted from his

Riskier investments involve greater uncertainty regarding the outcome, as
 well as the increased likelihood of some painful ones.
 So riskier investments are those for which the outcome is less certain.
 That is, the probability distribution of returns is wider.

Risk is the likelihood of losing money.
 The possibility of permanent capital loss is the only risk to worry about.

 the future holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Return alone - and especially return over short periods of time - says very

\begin_layout Itemize
Given the difficulty of quantifying the probability of loss, investors who
 want some objective measure of risk-adjusted return - and they are many
 - can only look to the so-called Sharpe ratio.
 It's the ratio of a portfolio's excess return (its return above "risk-less
 rate" - rate of short-term Treasury bills) to the standard deviation of
 the return.
 According to Howard Marks, it's the best we have.
 While it says nothing explicitly about the likelihood of loss, there may
 be reason to believe that the prices of fundamentally riskier securities
 fluctuate more than those of safer ones, and thus the Sharpe ratio has
 some relevance.
 However, it doesn't do a good job of measuring risk of future loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Worry and its relatives, distrust, skepticism and risk aversion are essential
 ingredients in a safe financial system.
 Worry keeps risky loans from being made, companies from taking on more
 debt than they can service, portfolios from becoming overly concentrated,
 and unproven schemes from turning into popular manias.
 When risk aversion are present as they should be, investors will question,
 investigate and act prudently.
 Investment risk comes primarily from too-high prices, and too-high prices
 often come from excessive optimism and inadequate skepticism and risk aversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Risk arises as investor behavior alters the market.
 Investors bid up assets, accelerating into the present appreciation that
 otherwise would have occurred in the future, and thus lowering prospective
 returns.
 And as their psychology strengthens and they become bolder and less worried,
 investors cease to demand adequate risk premiums.
 The ultimate irony lies in the fact that the reward for taking incremental
 risk shrinks as more people move to take it.
 Thus, the market is not a static arena in which investors operate.
 It is responsive, shaped by investors' own behavior.
 Their increasing confidence creates more that they should worry about,
 just as their rising fear and risk aversion combine to widen risk premiums
 at the same time as they reduce risk.
 "I wouldn't buy that at any price - everyone knows it's too risky." That's
 something Howard has heard a lot in his life, and it has given rise to
 the best investment opportunities he has participated in.
 The truth is, the herd is wrong about risk at least as often as it is about
 return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Risk may have been present even though loss didn't occur.
 Therefore, the absence of loss does not necessarily mean the portfolio
 was safely constructed.
 The risk control is invisible in good times but still essential, since
 good times can so easily turn into bad times.
 Loss is what happens when risk meets adversity.
 Risk gives rise to loss only when negative events occur in the environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A good builder is able to avoid construction flaws, while a poor builder
 incorporates construction flaws.
 When there are no earthquakes, you can't tell the difference.
 Likewise, an excellent investor may be one who - rather than reporting
 higher returns than others - achieves the same return but does so with
 less risk (or even achieves a slightly lower return with far less risk).
 Controlling the risk in your portfolio is a very important and worth-while
 pursuit.
 The fruits, however, come only in the form of losses than don't happen.
 Such what-if calculations are difficult in placid times.
 This is the ultimate paradox of risk management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Risk control is the best route to loss avoidance.
 Risk avoidance, on the other hand, is likely to lead to return avoidance
 as well.
 The road to long-term investment success runs through risk control more
 than through aggressiveness.

 how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness
 of their winners.
 Skillful risk control is the mark of the superior investor.

And, of course, as demonstrated by the experience of Nifty Fifty investors,

 shares outstanding will perform better - because there are fewer shares
 for the people who want to buy it.
 All factors being equal, the smaller company should be the "rip-roaring
 performer".

 Demand needs to be high to drive stock prices higher.
 Institutional buying is the best source of demand in the stock market.
 Mutual funds, pension plans, banks, government bodies, and insurance companies
 are all institutional investors.
 They buy millions of shares at once.
 O'Neil likes his stocks to be owned by a few institutions.

Like Graham, O'Neil likes automation.
 He uses stop losses.
 O'Neil stops his losses at 8% of new money placed in a stock.
 He's specific on the new money requirement.
 If you own a stock that's risen 50% and it slides back 10%, that's not
 necessarily a time to stop losses because overall you're ahead 40%.
 It's only with the addition of new money, when a loss means you're actually
 behind, that O'Neil advocates stopping losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While he abhors averaging down, O'Neil advocates averaging up, also called
 pyramiding.
 The plan is simply to move more money into your stocks that are increasing
 in value.
 This is the opposite of stopping losses when you're wrong.
 Pyramiding magnifies winnings when you're right.
 "Your objective in the market was not to be right but to make big money
 when you were right." If the stock rises, pyramid more money into it up
 to 5% past the buying point.
\end_layout

He believes that a focused portfolio is better than a diversified one.
 He emphasizes that "the winning investor's objective should be to have
 one of two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits." It's best
 to make gradual moves into and out of a stock.
 Too many people are hesitant to move their money.
 TO overcome this hesitation, he recommends buying and selling in parcels.
 If you own a stock you love and it starts dropping in value, sell part
 of it as an insurance policy.
 If it rebounds, fine.
 You made back part of the loss with the money you kept in the stock.
 Like all insurance policies, you won't always need to use this one.
 Ask yourself how much worse it would have been if you hadn't sold part
 of the position.

He finds bargains by comparing a stock's current price with its future prospects.
 He does not look only at historical data to see whether it's cheap based

Cheap present value of future free cash flow - that factor has it all to

 Net income is the money left after a company pays its bills, taxes, interest

 Free cash flow is the money left after a company uses its net income for
 capital expenditures, known as CAPEX, which is buying new equipment, buildings,
 or land to improve its business.
 So, free cash flow is what's left when there are no more expenses.
 Everything is paid and there's just a pile of cash in a bank account that's
 free for other uses.
 The regular stream of such cash into the account is the flow.
 Free cash flow per share divided by the stock price.

 Sadly, America is on that same course because we haven’t learned from history.
 We only memorize historical dates and names, not the lesson."

“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should actually
 come down.
 Of course, that is often only true in theory.
 Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance.
 If schools taught people about money, there would be more money and lower
 prices.
 But schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to
 harness money’s power.

"I don’t encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to.
 Knowing what I know about running a company, I wouldn't wish that task
 on anyone.
 There are times when people can’t find employment and starting a company
 seems like the best solution.
 But the odds are against success: Nine out of ten companies fail in five
 years.
 Of those that survive the first five years, nine out of every ten of those
 eventually fail as well.
 So only if you really have the desire to own your own company do I recommend
 it.
 Otherwise, keep your day job and mind your own business.
 When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep your asset
 column strong."

"As your cash flow grows, you can indulge in some luxuries.
 An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the
 poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.
 The poor and the middle class often buy luxury items like big houses, diamonds,
 furs, jewelry, or boats because they want to look rich.
 They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit.
 The old-money people, the long-term rich, build their asset column first.
 Then the income generated from the asset column buys their luxuries.
 The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood, and
 children’s inheritance."

 the rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class.
 Having two fathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist,
 I quickly began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more
 financial sense to me.
 It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized themselves due
 to their lack of financial education.
 No matter what the “take-from-the-rich” crowd came up with, the rich always
 found a way to outsmart them.
 That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle class.
 The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood the
 power of money, a subject not taught in schools."

"I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad
 areas of expertise:" 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Accounting - It is financial literacy or the ability to read numbers.
 This is a vital skill if you want to build an empire.
 The more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required,
 or the house comes tumbling down.
 This is the left-brain side, or the details.
 Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements
 which allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Investing - It is the science of “money making money.” This involves strategies
 and formulas which use the creative right-brain side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Understanding markets - it is the science of supply and demand.
 You need to know the technical aspects of the market, which are emotion-driven,
 in addition to the fundamental or economic aspects of an investment.
 Does an investment make sense or does it not make sense based on current
 market conditions?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The law - A corporation wrapped around the technical skills of accounting,
 investing, and markets can contribute to explosive growth.
 A person who understands the tax advantages and protections provided by
 a corporation can get rich so much faster than someone who is an employee
 or a small-business sole proprietor.
 It’s like the difference between someone walking and someone flying.
 The difference is profound when it comes to long-term wealth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Tax advantages - A corporation can do many things that an employee cannot,
 like pay expenses before paying taxes.
 That is a whole area of expertise that is very exciting.
 Employees earn and get taxed, and they try to live on what is left.
 A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything
 that is left.
 It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use.
 They’re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that
 are producing good cashflow.
 For example, by owning your own corporation, your vacations can be board
 meetings in Hawaii.
 Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships are company
 expenses.
 Most restaurant meals are partial expenses, and on and on.
 But it’s done legally with pre-tax dollars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Protection from lawsuits - We live in a litigious society.
 Everybody wants a piece of your action.
 The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations
 and trusts to protect their assets from creditors.
 When someone sues a wealthy individual, they are often met with layers
 of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns
 nothing.
 They control everything, but own nothing.
 The poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to the government
 or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich.
 They learned it from the Robin Hood story: Take from the rich, and give
 it to the poor.
